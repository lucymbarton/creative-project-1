                        Buenos dias! Como estan?
                        <br><br>
                         Alernate Subject line: el fin.
                         <br><br>
                         This will be my last email ðŸ˜± Today we have P-day because of the general authorities visiting next week. Tomorrow, my companions will drop me off at the mission office, I'll spend the night at the mission home, and then I'll be going to the airport on Monday morning! I just honestly can't believe that my entire mission is already done. Yes, I've had 7 areas, 15 companions, 75 p days, and a little more than 17 months as a missionary, but I feel like I'll be missing out on things when I leave. There is just so much work to do and so many people to reach! Luckily, I know that there will also be people to serve and teach back in Utah.
                         <br><br>
                         If you see me after I get home and I'm acting strangely, just give me a couple months and I'll get back to acting like a normal person. Hopefully. lol
                         <br><br>
                         So here's the week:
                         <br><br>
                         On Monday we went to the mission office to pick up Sister Graham's phone and also to drop off my bike so I could ship it home. We got lunch at Raising Cane's and then played some basketball at the church with our district. That night we visited a less active family in our ward, the Bartons! We figured we had a pretty good in because I was going to be like "Hey we're family!!!" but when we knocked on the door, a kid answered. Then we heard Brother Barton yelling from the other room "I'm working! I'm on the phone with Brazil! I don't know who these people are!" When he found out it was us he did not change his mind lol. It was so awkward.
                         <br><br>
                         Tuesday we had dinner with Brother and Sister Besch and they fed us spaghetti :) Members never feed us spaghetti because they think that everyone feeds us spaghetti. But I love spaghetti so I wish that they would lol. They are going to go get sealed today at the temple! That night we went to a "Back to School" Relief Society activity and we played a bunch of games from school like Hang Man and Heads up Seven up. It was fun :)
                         <br><br>
                         Wednesday we had my last district council! Elder Thompson (who apparently is an animation major and has an internship at Cartoon Network waiting for him) drew cartoon characters of us on the whiteboard. I was just a tombstone because I'm going home. That night we had dinner with the Brown family and they invited the Phillips. The wife was a less active member and the husband was not a member. We shared some verses out of Alma 34 and talked about the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The spirit was so strong. I love teaching. And I love the Book of Mormon.
                         <br><br>
                         Thursday we visited with Karen. I'm pretty sure I've mentioned her before but she is awaiting a double lung transplant and also taking care of her mom that is on hospice. She picked us up some fajitas from a Mexican restaurant and they were very authentic and very delicious. Karen loves to tell us all about her life and how she came back to the gospel.
                         <br><br>
                         Thursday evening we met with a less active family the Thomases. One of their sons just got diagnosed with cancer :( They haven't been to church in a while so it was a good sign that they were willing to have us over. Their ministering brother came with us and we had a good discussion about our life on earth and drawing closer to God. Also Brother Thomas talked a lot about cars. He loves cars.
                         <br><br>
                         Yesterday we went and cleaned out the library at the church because that room has not been touched in a long time. There were so many old things in there. Tapes, VCRs, huge video cameras, old projectors, a wall phone, and a lot of dust. We talked to our member Sister Shannon and she talked to us for a long time about her testimony and her experiences with personal revelation.
                         <br><br>
                         We went to the park and some lady yelled at us from her car "Throw your book of 'Morons' in the trash!! It's full of lies and there will be consequences for what you're doing!!"
                         <br><br>
                         I was like "lol I haven't heard that one before"
                         <br><br>
                         Today we're going to get pedicures! And I'm going to pack all my stuff. Fun day... President and Sister Richards want us to deep clean the apartment today to prepare for the mission tour next week.
                         <br><br>
                         Well everyone. Thanks for sticking with me. Serving a mission was something I honestly was not looking forward to before I went. It has definitely been the hardest thing I've ever done. I have been forced thousands of miles outside my comfort zone. I've endured quarentines, rejections, hard companions, freak storms, long days, and so many other things, but I've also been happier and found more joy than I have ever experienced.
                         <br><br>
                         Yesterday I finished reading the Book of Mormon for the 11th time since I started 1 Nephi on the plane to Houston. I can honestly say that I will never be the same. I know with all that I am that the Book of Mormon is true. I am eternally grateful for all of the knowledge that I have gained by choosing to serve a mission. I am eternally grateful for all of the people that I have met by choosing to serve a mission. I am eternally grateful for all of the experiences that I have had, good and bad, because I chose to serve a mission.
                         <br><br>
                         If you want to see me after I get home, we're having an open house on Tuesday the 17th at 5:30-8:30pm. There will be root beer floats!
                         <br><br>
                         My address is:
                         <br><br>
                         REDACTED
                         <br><br>
                         Feel free to stop by!
                         <br><br>
                         I will also be speaking in church on the 29th! It will be at 12pm!
                         <br><br>
                         The church address is:
                         <br><br>
                         5623 Mirabella Dr, Herriman, UT 84096
                         <br><br>
                         (Also I'm pretty sure they're still broadcasting so let me know if you want the link)
                         <br><br>
                         Spiritual thought:
                         <br><br>
                         Ether 12:41
                         41 And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever. Amen.
                         <br><br>
                         Why have I been serving a mission for the past 75 weeks? Why did I leave my family, friends, school, work, and everything else behind? Because I love Jesus Christ. I know He lives and I know that He has strengthened me a lot more than I realize. If you feel like you don't know Him personally, I would encourage you to seek Him. I promise that He is there and He will hear you, guide you, love you, and give you power.
                         <br><br>
                         It is all true.
                         <br><br>
                         Les quiero
                         <br><br>
                         Love yall
                         <br><br>
                         Signing off,
