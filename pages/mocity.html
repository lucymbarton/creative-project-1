                      Another week, another area, another companion. 
                      <br><br>
                      This week was legit an adventure. So I've been in Grand Mission all week, though I was supposed to go to Missouri City last Monday,  but Hermana Ralphs (who is in Missouri City) was sick. Good news is that their COVID tests are negative so I'll be going to Missouri City today! 
                      <br><br>
                      Monday we had transfers and I got to see my daughter Hermana Oveson!!! It was so exciting and I love her! We went to Kroger and then we went and got ice cream with the district. 
                      <br><br>
                      Tuesday we spent a fat minute at the Mission office because the sisters in Grand Mission are part of the Facebook team for the mission. Sounds exciting but it is actually pretty boring and takes a long time. I made a couple of ads for Easter and Hermana Crandall edited a video in Spanish. That morning we also went to this place called Reining Strength that does therapeutic horseback riding and we got trained on how to be volunteers. We went to this guy named Tim's house and he lived on this property with about 8 other men and when we pulled up there were just some guys outside with a rifle and we thought we might die lol but we set a lesson with Tim at the church. 
                      <br><br>
                      Wednesday we had district council. It was a pretty good time. The elders' friends were getting married on Friday and the elders needed some burgundy ties but they didnt have any miles so we went tie shopping for them! We went to Ross, Tjmaxx, Walmart and finally Kohl's had the ties we were looking for. And we got them like 75% off so it was a good deal. We had a lesson with Matt and Anamarie and discussed some of the New Testament. 
                      <br><br>
                      Thursday was another content team day but we spent even longer at the office. But there was an MLC call and we got to be on zoom on the computer and see everyone's faces at the same time so that was fun. We went to the Wilks family's house that night for a lesson and they talked our ears off, but I learned a lot. The dad is a police officer and the mom was telling us how she never sweats the small stuff with him and just loves him always because she doesn't know for sure if he'll come home from work every day. So that made me want to always love my husband. 
                      <br><br>
                      Friday, we got to help at the elders friends' wedding! They needed someone to hold the iPad for the Zoom and invited us to do it! Samantha and Luis got married in the relief society room and it was so cute! Before the wedding, we pulled up at the church just in time to help Samantha carry a bunch of things in from her car. So I guess you could say that we saved the wedding. 
                      <br><br>
                      We also went and taught the Passewe (pronounced passaway) family. Princess and Princeston are preparing to be baptized! They are 16 and 10, respectively, and they are both excited to receive the holy ghost. 
                      <br><br>
                      Saturday we taught Gail and Michael who are from Scotand so it was so fun to listen to their accents! 
                      <br><br>
                      Sunday we got 5 of our people at church!! But the bad news was that when we went out to drive to church, there was a big moving truck blocking our car and nobody was around. So we had to bike to church. In the pouring rain. Lol we showed up to church absolutely soaked but at least we got there. We had a lot of meetings because they're over 2 wards in this area. I shared my testimony in our second sacrament meeting and a little girl got up after me and thanked me for coming to their ward ðŸ˜­
                      <br><br>
                      Spiritual thought: 
                      Alma 24:19
                      19 And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace.
                      <br><br>
                      I was reading the story of the Anti-Nephi-Lehis yesterday and this verse stuck out to me. It was interesting that the Nephites who had rebelled and joined up with the Lamanites were too hard-hearted to be converted. The chapter says that they weren't converted because they had already known the truth and turned from it, but the Lamanites listed to what Ammon and his brothers said and they believed and they became firm in the faith. So much that they buried their weapons. I think that they used to believe that their weapons were "weapons of peace" because that was the way they lived for the longest time, fighting with their brethren, but when they opened their hearts to the truth, they realized that their weapons of war were actually keeping them from peace. And they had the faith to bury them, come what may.

                      Les quiero 
                      <br><br>
                      Love yall 
                      <br><br><br>
