                    Good morning everyone! Happy P-day!
                    <br><br>
                    This week went by really fast! My companions are so funny! Hermana Eliason is lactose intolerant but she just keeps eating stuff with milk in it and Hermana Crookston and I are like "you're going to die!!" And she says "yeah but it'll be worth it!" And then she gets sick and spends a lot of time in the bathroom!
                    <br><br>
                    We did a lot of service this week for a lady in the English ward who has a beauty salon but decided to stop renting her space and then she had a lot of stuff at her place and we went over and helped her organize all of that too. It was a really nice break from our apartment. 
                    <br><br>
                    On Sunday we had really run out of food but we got fed a ton by two members and we got the sacrament! It was awesome. 
                    <br><br>
                    This week we will be trying to get our friend Lesly on date to be baptized! We are going to be meeting with her in person at the church for the first time! We can meet in the church with masks and lots of hand sanitizer! 
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing else really this week. I've been going through some heart break! But I love this quote from Elder Holland. 
                    <br><br>
                    "Because the Restoration reaffirmed the foundational truth that God does work in this world, we can hope, we should hope, even when facing the most insurmountable odds...
                        So, I ask, “If so many of our 1820 hopes could begin to be fulfilled with a flash of divine light to a mere boy kneeling in a patch of trees in upstate New York, why should we not hope that righteous desires and Christlike yearnings can still be marvelously, miraculously answered by the God of all hope?” We all need to believe that what we desire in righteousness can someday, someway, somehow yet be ours....
                    Truly when hope is gone, what we have left is the flame of the inferno raging on every side.
                        So, when our backs are to the wall and, as the hymn says, “other helpers fail and comforts flee,” among our most indispensable virtues will be this precious gift of hope linked inextricably to our faith in God and our charity to others."
                        <br><br>
                    Love you all! Hope you have a good week!
                    <br><br><br>
                    Hermana Barton
