                    Buenas dÃ­as familia y amigos!!
                    <br><br>
                    Esta semana went by really fast!!
                    <br><br>
                    On Tuesday we got to meet with our friend Lesly in person and WE SET HER ON DATE TO BE BAPTIZED!! July 12th!! We are so excited for Lesly to be baptized! She is excited and wants her whole family to come because she wants to be a good example to them. Lesly is awesome! 
                    <br><br>
                    On Wednesday I got to have a Spanish tutoring call with Hermano Astorga!! It was great!! 
                    <br><br>
                    But the same day my ear started hurting!! And even though I was putting heat on it, it got worse the next day! So I called our mission nurse and she gave me permission to use the Connect Care App to see a doctor and I got prescribed some antibiotics. But after 24 hours my ear still hurt A LOT and I also couldn't hear! (Hence the subject line. "Como?" Is what you say if you want someone to repeat what they said!) So on Friday we went to the emergency room! It was a pretty pleasant experience actually. They looked at my ear and said I should be using drops along with the antibiotics. and they prescribed me some pain pills! And today my ear is feeling a lot better!
                    <br><br>
                    The pain pills make me drowsy and I had to lay down to let my ear drain, so I spent a lot of time this week in bed. It was actually quite nice. But I'm excited to go head first back into missionary work this week!! We saw a lot of miracles this week with receiving a referral and contacting formers that sound really interested! And we saw a rainbow last night!! 
                    <br><br>
                    Oh and Thursday was my 100th day as a missionary! So to celebrate we went to Buffalo Wild Wings and got BOGO boneless wings! 
                    <br><br>
                    And last Monday we went to Bucees! It's a famous giant gas station/ souvenir shop! It was really fun. 
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual thought:
                    <br><br>
                    Alma 26:35-36
                    35 Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.
                    36 Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us, wanderers in a strange land.
                    <br><br>
                    I think Ammon really says it all! God is Good!!
                    <br><br>
                    Have a great week everyone! Love you and pray for you all! ðŸ’“ðŸ’“
