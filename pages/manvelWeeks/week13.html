                    Good morning my people! 
                    <br><br>
                    This week has been kinda crazy.
                    <br><br>
                    So to start out, We have a new companion! Her name is Hermana Eliason and she is from California. She served 8 months in Argentina and was reassigned to our mission. It has been interesting to have her here since in Argentina she had such a different mission experience. Like she would only speak in Spanish and they didn't have smart phones! So it's been a lot of showing her how to use the Area Book Planer app and Facebook and everything. 
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking of Facebook, my area got a Facebook page! It's something like Followers of Jesus Christ in Friendswood and Pearland Texas. Y'all can like it if you want to. I'll also be sharing some of our posts to my personal page. Oh and I found out at transfers on Monday that I didn't actually get called as the Social Media Specialist so that's awkward. But I might be getting called as the Social Media Specialist's assistant soon. But still pretty awkward. RIP.
                    <br><br>
                    President asked Hermana Crookston and I to help put together a video welcoming all the new missionaries and on Monday we got a bunch of clips from other missionaries and stitched them together and showed it at Transfers and President didn't like it I guess. So on Tuesday I clipped the videos and put them together differently and put music behind them and the APs and President liked it a lot better. Maybe President will bring us In n Out Burger now!
                    <br><br>
                    So on Tuesday night we really thought we were going to die! Well, my companions did. I was pretty much dead asleep and I heard pounding on our front door and then I heard Hermana Crookston say "Is someone knocking?" and then I heard her go and open the front door and there were people out there so then I got out of bed to go see what was happening.
                    So apparently some Hermanas who had just come from the mission office had forgotten to grab the keys to their apartment (they live in our same complex) and had been pounding on our door since 10:30. Hermana Eliason and Hermana Crookston thought that the raids had made it here to Manvel (kinda funny because it's just a tiny little down full of trailer parks) and they locked themselves in the bathroom and were crying and praying. And they just left me there asleep in my bed to die! Lol. Then Hermana Crookston was like "I need to check my phone!" and she had like 20 missed calls. So we had to drive over to the church at like 11:30pm so the Hermanas could park their car there since they didn't have a permit yet and then they slept on our floor that night. It was pretty crazy. 
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking of the raids, the George Floyd funeral is going to be happening tomorrow in Pearland. Literally 10 minutes away from my apartment! So we are not allowed to leave our apartment today or tomorrow in case some crazy stuff goes down. We got permission to go shopping on Saturday, so we will be fine with food!
                    <br><br>
                    My parents Door Dashed us some really yummy Mexican food this week and Hermana Crookston said it was the best food she'd had on her entire mission!
                    <br><br>
                    Hermana Eliason likes to listen to the Saints book during meals and then she goes and lays in her bed and listens and twice this week she has just fallen asleep and Hermana Crookston and I didn't know what to do to wake her up! It was quite hilarious. We have this little silver bell that someone left here and we were ringing it and ringing it but Hermana Eliason had Beats headphones on and couldn't hear it!
                    <br><br>
                    We had the great opportunity to hear from Elder Soares of the Quorum of the 12 Apostles this week! He is such a cute man! He talked about how if we have faith we can make it through all of the "pandemics" of our lives. 
                    <br><br>
                    Institute with David Butler this week was amazing. He talked about how the one word that describes God's purpose is "Become" and the word that describes how he achieves his purpose is "Jesus" and the word for how we can achieve Eternal life is "Gospel". Then he talked about how the creation story is actually poetic and not how it actually went down. It was really awesome.
                    <br><br>
                    On Friday we had our first district council in person! It was weird. On Friday also we had another lesson with Maria and tried to get her on date again and she said no... So that was awkward too.
                    <br><br>
                    Our friend Lesly is still progressing quite well, but she said one of the churches she goes to opened!! And she still doesn't quite understand that if the Book of Mormon is true ( and she loves reading it) that all of the other churches don't have the fullness of the gospel! But I guess since our church isn't open yet it can't necessarily hurt for her to go to a different one on Sunday.
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual thought:
                    <br><br>
                    Mosiah 4: 9-10
                    <br><br>
                    9 Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.
                    <br><br>
                    10 And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.
                    <br><br>
                    I love these scriptures! Truly it is a comfort to my soul to know that we have a loving Heavenly Father who created this world for us. And I know that man cannot understand everything that God can. Of course sometimes it is hard to wonder WHY! Why do I have these trials? Why is there COVID-19? Why do we need to be baptized? Why do we need to repent? But We can trust in God. He comprehendeth all things and He loves us and wants what is best for us.
                    <br><br>
                    I also love the very end of verse 10. "And now, if ye believe all these things SEE THAT YE DO THEM." It can be pretty easy to simply believe in God and believe that Jesus Christ lived and died for us so that we can be forgiven, but it is harder to ACT on that faith. But I know with all my heart that when we do the little things like praying, reading the scriptures, and repenting every day, we will be able to feel the spirit more strongly and receive that power from God to help us in our every day lives. 
                    <br><br>
