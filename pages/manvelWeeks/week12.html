                    Hola familia y amigos!!!
                    <br><br>
                     Happy Monday! And Happy June! Today I have finished 2 transfers of my mission! And I finished my "first" transfer in the field! We are going to have a very crazy summer here in the THSM. We expect to get 200 missionaries by the end of August! And we will receive 64 missionaries in June. In fact, Hermana Crookston and I will be driving to the mission office tonight to pick up our new companion! We will be a trio this transfer.
                     <br><br>
                     On Tuesday this week, we went down to a park in Friendswood to film a video about the new Restoration Proclamation with our Zone. It was really weird to meet our Zone leaders in real life... Elder Borden is like 6'5" and he is a real giant. Also I got 6 mosquito bites from the park! Bugs like to eat me I guess.
                     <br><br>
                     On Tuesday we also got take out from Buffalo Wild Wings (B Dubs) and that was exciting! And we went to deliver a libro de mormon to an old referral that actually never got his book and he wasn't home so we gave his libro to a man named Julio who may or may not be his husband?? And then he never answered our calls so that was awkward.
                     <br><br>
                     There have been a few thunderstorms this week! Once lightning struck right outside our window! It was so loud! And exciting.
                     <br><br>
                     On Thursday we had a devotional with Jarom and Spencer from the Safety Zone (a funny show about missionary safety) and one of the directors from the Book of Mormon Videos! It was really cool.
                     <br><br>
                     On Friday, we had our first "Institute" class with David Butler! It was so amazing! We read from John 1 and talked about the Good News of the Gospel and how we're all saved by the grace of Jesus Christ! We talked about how in the vision of the tree of life there are two groups of people who hold onto the rod and make it to the tree, but the second group, after continually holding fast to the rod, make it to the tree and FALL DOWN! We learn that the tree represents Jesus Christ, so we can see that these people have known Christ more than the other group who made it to the tree and ended up leaving.
                     In John 1, we read that when John the Baptist sees Jesus, he says, "Behold the Lamb of God!" and we can see that John also knew Christ as he could tell just by seeing him that he was the Son of God! We should ask ourselves "Where am I in my relationship with Christ? If I saw him, would I fall down? Would I be able to recognize him and say "this is the Lamb of God!"?
                     <br><br>
                     For movie night we watched the first half of 17 miracles.
                     <br><br>
                     On Sunday we got the Sacrament from la familia Peña and they brought us food! It was really good food. And it was great to get the sacrament! It was awkward because they really weren't supposed to stay for very long but they stayed for a long time. We sang 3 hymns all the way through and they shared their testimonies and everything. It was awkward because they wouldn't look at me because I guess they thought I couldn't understand anything but I really understood like 95% of it so it was just kinda rude of them to not look at me. :\ We disinfected everything after they left.
                     <br><br>
                     So that's my week!
                     <br><br>
                     Here's some scriptures I liked this week:
                     <br><br>
                     1 Nephi 16:1-2
                      1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speaking to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear.
                     2 And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I had spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center.
                     <br><br>
                     2 Nephi 10:23
                     23 Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves—to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.
                     <br><br>
                     2 Nephi 26:13, 33
                     13 And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among the children of men according to their faith.
                     33 For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.
                     <br><br>
                     2 Nephi 33:6
                     6 I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.
                     <br><br>
                     I know that Christ lives! I know that we have been saved through Him! And that is the Good News of the Gospel! I know that he loves all of us individually and that there is a great plan laid out for each of us!
                     <br><br>
                     Love you all!
                     <br><br><br>
                     Hermana Barton
                     <br><br>
                     PS. So we heard this week that we will be allowed to go and do service like helping with yard work and stuff! Any maybe we'll be able to meet in the church buildings with our district for district council! Exciting stuff!
