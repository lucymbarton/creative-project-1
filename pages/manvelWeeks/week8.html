                    Buenos dias famila y amigos!
                    <br><br>
                    This week was fair. It has been a difficult week for my family as my aunt Laura passed away this week from cancer. Please keep them in your prayers.
                    <br><br>
                    We heard from our president last night that although Texas has been opening up restaurants, theaters, and businesses to 25% capacity, nothing of our situation will change. We will still be in the apartments and only leaving for necessary trips. That was pretty much what I expected to happen. I think we are still pretty far away from being able to actually go out into the world and proselyte. 
                    <br><br>
                    A big bummer this week is that the lady we had on date to be baptized dropped us! Her name is Gloria and she was supposed to be baptized on the 16th of May but she told us she needs to figure out her life first before she commits to being baptized. We hope that she actually does come back to meet with us soon. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our most progressing Friend is Lesly! She is 19 (I believe) and she loves God and loves reading the Book of Mormon. At the end of every call that we have with her she asks when we can meet again. What's kinda awkward is she's told us about how much she likes her other church and I'm like "... you know who we are and what we do... right?" But she really likes to meet with us so we'll see how that goes.
                    <br><br>
                    BIG NEWS! WE SAW THE SNAKE!!
                    So on like Tuesday or Wednesday this week we went outside to walk around the pond in our complex and there was this lady walking towards us and she looked like she wanted to talk to us. Hermana Crookston got really excited at that lol. The lady said she just almost stepped on a snake and she turned back this way to go tell the apartment complex managers. She definitely told us to warn us so we didn't run into the snake, but we walked past her and tried to get a look at the snake. And we saw it!! He/she was a pretty long boi/goirl and it slithered down the grass and into the pond and we guess he lives in a hole on the side of the pond. Sadly this was the one time I left my phone in the apartment so no pictures. :(
                    <br><br>
                    If any of you are wondering how my schedule usually is, I'll tell you. We wake up at 6:30, exercise until 7, take turns showering and eating breakfast until 8, then we plan for the day. After planning we have personal study for an hour and then we usually go outside and walk around the pond. The rest of the day depends on when we have lessons scheduled, but we usually have 3 lessons and then we have to do 1 hour of Spanish study and 1 hour of Companion study. We have lunch from 12-1 and dinner from 5-6. Then at 9 we get ready for bed and lights are off at 10:30!
                    <br><br>
                    Also on Friday we had a goal to find or die! (hence the subject line) AKA we weren't going to watch the movie for movie night until we found someone. So we were calling all our formers on ABP and at 8:05 we set a lesson with someone who had already been taught! That counts as a find!! And the movie started at 8:15!! The movie we started this week was The Fighting Preacher. It was SOO good and I'm really excited to finish it this Friday.
                    <br><br>
                    If you made it to this point in my email send a reply and let me know how your weekend was!!
                    <br><br>
                    Les quiero mucho!
                    <br><br><br>
