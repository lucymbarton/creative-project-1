                    Buenos dias!!! 
                    <br><br>
                    How are you all? Happy Monday!!
                    <br><br>
                    This week we had Zone Conference! It was over Zoom and we just had the entire mission on it. We talked about our "why" of coming on the mission and of staying here. I've always never been able to figure out my "why" except it just felt right. But I decided that I came on my mission because Satan didn't want me to and I'm still here because now I just have no reason to go home! I'm sure if I was at home I'd be bored and depressed out of my mind! But out here I am doing great!!
                    <br><br>
                    Sister Guthrie shared a story about a little girl who bought a fake pearl necklace and loved it and then her father asked her to give it to him and she didn't want to. But eventually she did and he gave her a great big necklace with real pearls on it! So I decided to give up some of the problems I've been facing from at home. It's been pretty awesome. I don't even have to think about it anymore!! 
                    <br><br>
                    Hermana Crookston's mom sent a package and it had Squishmallows in it for me and Hermana Eliason!! Mine is a little kitty named Tabitha and she is so squishy. 
                    <br><br>
                    We had our interviews with President this week and mine went really well. I roasted a whole bunch of people and President said that I'm a perfect example of someone who has come to the mission and adjusted and just keeps improving every week and has that light of Christ! He said "Never lose that, Hermana!" and I said "I won't!"
                    <br><br>
                    In other big news, I am now the Facebook page admin for the Spanish page over Brazoria and Galveston Counties. It has been created and I have to figure out how I want to organize my missionaries to create posts so I can post them and we can hopefully find some people to teach on Facebook some day. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our most progressing investigators are still Lesly and Ivory! I love both of them!! Lesly is hopefully going to be baptized on July 12. She has injured her knee and is scared it will interfere with her baptism! We all need to pray for Lesly's knee. 
                    <br><br>
                    Ivory is just the sweetest man I've ever taught and we call him on the phone and he loves hearing from us! His entire family attends another church, but he says "People don't understand you Mormons. There's something really special about y'all ministering sisters. That's why we're still communicating."
                    We asked him to be baptized and he said he wants to! He talked to his mom (he's like 50 and still talks to his mom about stuff aw) and his mom said he should pray about it! So we told him that too! But we know for sure that he'll get that positive witness for himself of the truthfulness of our message. 
                    The only problem is that Ivory doesn't speak any Spanish!! So we're going to have to hand him over to the english sisters at some point. :( But we love him!!! 
                    <br><br>
                    That's about all from my week. We found a cockroach in our bathroom!! Oh and the gym in our complex is closed again since COVID cases have been surging in Houston again. There's already another stay-at-home order in Harris county, and I wouldn't be surprised if we get one in our county as well. 
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual thought!
                    <br><br>
                    Mosiah 4:11
                    11 And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.
                    <br><br>
                    I think it's funny how King Benjamin really tries to convince us how worthless we are without Christ. Like he's like "And He saves you Unworthy Creatures!!!"
                    <br><br>
                    Love y'all 
                    <br><br><br>
