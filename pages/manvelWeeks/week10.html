                    Buenos días familia y amigos!!
                    <br><br>
                    This week was full of miracles! 
                    <br><br>
                    On Tuesday we had Zone conference over Zoom. It was pretty good! We talked about having faith in Christ during this time.
                    <br><br>
                    We also were able to serve one of the members of our ward by (trying) to read with her 6 year old. At first we tried reading the Libro de Mormon with her, but that was too hard so we tried reading from the folletos! It was really cute because she would sound out every single letter lol. And somehow this 6 year old spoke Spanish better than I do and I was like "hang on that's not even fair."
                    <br><br>
                    On Wednesday the best thing happened!! The maintenance people from our apartment complex came!! They fixed our toilet seat!! And put new lightbulbs in! And fixed our door knobs! So now it's like we're living in a new apartment. And we don't have to worry about falling in the toilet anymore lol. 
                    <br><br>
                    On Thursday the maintenance people came again and installed some new blinds and gave us a new kitchen faucet (!!). The awkward thing was that we were in the middle of teaching a lesson so we had to go sit in our car and teach. I had my phone up on the dashboard with our Facebook Messenger video chat going and my phone overheated!! It shut down all my apps and ended the call. I had to hold my phone in front of the air conditioning vent so that I could turn on the hot spot so Hermana Crookston could call on her phone. Very eventful lesson lol. And my phone is fine, just probably melted a little bit inside lol.
                    <br><br>
                    So now our apartment is all fixed and there's light in our fridge and above our table and everything! We really got a new quality of life this week. (hence the subject line)
                    <br><br>
                    On Thursday night we got two referrals!! So on Friday we got permission to go over to their house and drop off some Libros de Mormon!!! My first visit to people in real life and my first two Book of Mormons handed out.  It was pretty exciting. On Friday we also had a lesson with Maria and we had invited her to read the Book of Mormon every day and pray to know that it was true and she said that if she knew it was true that she would be baptized! And she said she wants to be baptized!! We are very excited for her. She has been taught by the missionaries for 6 years! Her son just put in his mission papers and we are just very excited. No date set yet but we hope to get that this week. 
                    <br><br>
                    There was also a big thunder storm on Friday and that was pretty exciting. The pond in our complex was pretty full and we saw the snake again!! I got videos this time. 
                    <br><br>
                    We went on a couple bike rides in the neighborhood by our complex this week and it's a cute little neighborhood. Pics to come. 
                    <br><br>
                    On Sunday Obispo brought us the Sacrament! It has been hard for us to get the sacrament since members aren't technically supposed to come into our apartment according to our stake president but our bishop got special permission. Also I prayed on Saturday night that someone would bring us some food and some members (the peñas) brought us WhataBurger for lunch! (On Sunday... yeah but it was good)
                    <br><br>
                    So that's my week! Here's my spiritual thought. In Come Follow Me this week we are still studying in Mosiah. I love the example of the people of Alma in Mosiah 24:14-16. 
                    <br><br>

                    14 And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.
                        15 And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.
                        16 And it came to pass that so great was their faith and their patience that the voice of the Lord came unto them again, saying: Be of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage.
                        <br><br>
                    I love how it says that the people submitted cheerfully and with patience to the will of the Lord. I have had to work on this. I prayed for patience last week for the first time in my life. I've never done it before because people always say that when they pray for patience they get stuck in a traffic jam or something lol. But I've really had to develop patience and cheerfulness while I submit myself to the will of the Lord. I have faith in the will of God (el voluntad de Dios).
                    <br><br>
                    Also I've been reading the Book of Mormon a lot this week because I've been given the "Atonement Challenge" where we have to circle where Christ is mentioned, underline the Atonement, and highlight the Doctrine of Christ. It has been really exciting. I read through all of Alma and I'm already in Helaman 11. The Book of Mormon gets a lot more exciting when you read it faster, I've found. And I know that it has SO much POWER!!
                    <br><br>
                    Oh and we started teaching the other sisters in our zone Spanish this week and that was fun!
                    <br><br>
                    That's my week! If you got this far please send me your favorite recipe that takes less than 30 minutes to make! I'm running out of ideas for food to eat lol. Or send me your favorite crockpot recipe! I'm so excited to hear from you all!!
                    <br><br>
                    Love y'all
                    <br><br><br>
