                    Hola familia y amigos! 
                    <br><br>
                    This week went a lot better than last week! I have had like a million times more motivation to actually be a missionary lol. 
                    <br><br>
                    Let's get into it!
                    <br><br>
                    So my new apartment is actually in Manvel, Texas. (despite what my parents keep telling you, I'm not IN Friendswood, I'm actually about 30 minutes away from Friendswood, although it is in my area. we have a very big area right now) We have taken over an area from the Elders in addition to our original area, so we are now over two areas! The Elders had to leave because we just don't have enough missionaries to have two companionships in a ward. We lost about 30 missionaries last month with all the Corona changes and then this transfer we also opened up a new stake with 10 wards that we got from the Texas Houston mission. So we really are quite short on missionaries right now. We are hoping to get more missionaries next transfer which is in June.
                    <br><br>
                    So funny story... We were supposed to get the elder's SIM card when we took over their area. And President said he gave Hermana Crookston a post it note with the SIM card taped on it, but we don't really remember a post it note. All we have is an envelope that says "Manvel North Sims Card" so obviously we assumed the SIM card was in there. It wasn't... so we called the APs and they said that it wasn't a big deal. But then we got a message from President. "CALL ME ASAP!" So we called him. President asked Hermana Crookston to think back on when they were talking in the parking lot of the mission office and he gave her the SIM card on the post it note. Hermana Crookstone couldn't remember the post it note, just the envelope. President said "I didn't give you the envelope. I told Sister Guthrie yesterday that Elder Button had so many envelopes in the office that I decided I was not going to touch any of them so I didn't mess anything up. So forget about the envelope!" But we couldn't forget about the envelope because it was the only thing we had. President told us to pray and look for the post it note. And we did. And we never found the SIM card. And we never forgot about the envelope. Sorry President.
                    <br><br>
                    I love my new apartment complex! There's this little pond in the middle of it full of turtles and ducks and fish and apparently snakes. There is this cute family of Herons that come here to fish as well. Every time we go outside we get to walk around the pond and watch the turtles and try to see the snakes. They are cute little turtles.
                    <br><br>
                    Oh and I got my first Texas ant bite! I wasn't paying attention to where I was stepping and I stepped on an ant hill. But I only got one bite, which is good. For those who don't know, you can't just frolic in the grass here like you can in Utah. There are ant hills literally everywhere and they will eat you alive. :)
                    <br><br>
                    My companion Hermana Crookston is really fun! She has a boyfriend, Austin, at home who she is going to marry this December. It has been really nice to talk to her about Jacob since she really understands a lot of how I feel. She is hard working and we have been teaching 3 or 4 lessons every day. We teach a lot of member lessons and that keeps us busy. Those of you at home should see if the missionaries in your area want to teach you a lesson! Because I'm sure they are probably bored out of their minds lol. In my last area pretty much all of our lessons were in Spanish, but here there are a lot more "Spanish speaking people" who actually prefer English. So we've been teaching a lot of lessons in English. Which is weird. And I don't have an excuse for not knowing what to say lol. 
                    <br><br>
                    Since we don't have many missionaries, there is only one district in our zone. Which makes our district our zone and our zone our district. But we still have a District Leader and Zone Leaders. They have developed a rivalry.
                    <br><br>
                    Our Zone is having a family history competition where we get points by attatching sources and memories and creating new people. I have moved on to the 2nd round!! 
                    <br><br>
                    Oh and on Friday we had a devotional from David Archuleta! President Guthrie has a lot of connections and we love hearing from all his famous friends! :)
                    <br><br>
                    And have I told you all about Pres90X? Every morning at 6:30, President does a Zoom call where he leads us in some exercise. Most of the time it's a lot of squats and lunges and pushups, but it really goes hard! I've been losing weight here on my mission! (something most Texan missionaries cannot say)
                    <br><br>
                    Here's my spiritual thought!!
                    In my personal study, I came across this verse in Mosiah 7.
                    23 And now, is not this grievous to be borne? And is not this, our affliction, great? Now behold, how great reason we have to mourn.
                    I can relate to this verse very much! My mom knows that I love to feel sorry for myself, so when I read this verse I was like "haha that's me" and I'm sure a lot of you can also relate to this. With all the Corona and people being sick and dying and having to be stuck inside and not seeing our friends and family, is this not grievous to be borne? And how great reason we have to mourn! Right?
                    The answer to these questions is found in verse 33!
                    33 But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.
                    Soooo if we turn to the Lord with all our hearts, trust Him, and serve Him, He will DELIVER US out of bondage! (according to his own will and pleasure(which we should trust in also))
                    I loved this verse so much that I wrote it on sticky note and put it on my wall. Because even though it seems like everything in life gives me great reason to mourn, I know that I can trust in God's plan for me and for the world. And I know that the best place for me and for you all is as close to God as we can be. That is where peace is found. :)
                    <br><br>
                    Thanks to everyone who sent kind messages and packages and letters! I have more candy now than I know what do do with.
                    <br><br>
                    Love you all and miss you so much!
                    <br><br><br>
