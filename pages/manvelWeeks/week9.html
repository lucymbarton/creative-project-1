                    Buenos dias familia y amigos! Un otro dia de preparacion ha venido! 
                    <br><br>
                    How are you all? I am still here, in Texas, sitting on the same plastic chair and at the same plastic table! Smelling the same weed! Loving the missionary life right now. üôÉ 
                    <br><br>
                    Many parts of our apartment are actually broken at the moment. Some of our doorknobs are falling off, our toilet seat is broken, the sink leaks, the lightbulbs are burning out, the dryer takes 3 cycles to actually dry our clothes, the light in the refrigerator is out, our blinds are broken, and it very frequently reeks of weed! We sent in a maintenance request but we haven't heard anything back. So we're still living here just dealing with it all. At least the air conditioning works and so does our oven and mircrowave!
                    <br><br>
                    We had a really cool devotional this last Tuesday by a man namd David Butler. I believe he teaches at BYU? I'd never heard of him before. He shared a really cool message. He told us to imagine the scene where the Israelites were escaping Egypt and they came up on the Red Sea with the strongest army in the world at the time coming up behind them. He asked "What would be the title of this picture? Probably 'Big Mistake' or 'Distaster' well I'd call it 'Edge of a Miracle'" (hence the subject line) He said that miracles never come when everything goes exactly how we expect it to go. So when everything seems like a disaster and you feel like a complete mess, remember that you're on the edge of a miracle! I loved that.

                    I was very blessed this week to be able to watch the online stream of my aunt Laura's funeral. It was very sad not to be able to be there in person, but I was able to go to a church building (for the first time since I've been here apart from the mission office) and use a computer there to watch the stream. The service was very sweet and I send lots of love to my family. ‚ù§‚ù§
                    <br><br>
                    Today marks 2 months since I entered the MTC. 2 months sounds like a long time and it feels like I've been here foooreeevveerrrrrrrr. But I still have 15ish months left until I'll come home. And at this point it looks like I'll be stuck inside for the majority of my mission. I just might go psycho.

                    On Saturday, Hermana Crookston had 100 days left on her mission so we went to Chickfila and made Keto baby cheesecakes. They are pretty good for not having any sugar in them. 
                    <br><br>
                    We have finally been able to contact a few of the people that the Elders were teaching in their area that we took over. Oh and there's news on the SIM card! We got 3 new sisters in this week who were serving in Korea and got reassigned to our mission. While the sisters were at the mission office, one of them saw something shiny on the ground in the parking lot! It was a SIM card!! We are not for sure that it is our SIM card because President hasn't tested it out yet but we are pretty sure. Hopefully it didn't get ruined by sitting in the parking lot for 3 weeks...
                    <br><br>
                    Still having some rough times this week, wondering why God called me here at this time and in this place and trying my best to focus on my missionary purpose. It's really hard to be here when I'm not really sure why I wanted to serve a mission and why I want to stay. Hopefully I will figure it out.
                    <br><br>
                    How are you all??  Please email me I'm lonely!!! There's nothing fun to do here except read emails during the week and I literally only got 1! I am so bored.
