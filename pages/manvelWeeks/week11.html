                    Hola familia y amigos!
                    <br><br>
                    Another week in the mission!
                    <br><br>
                    Last Monday we were able to go to a park with the other missionaries in our District and we ate Raising Cane's and threw a frisbee around. It was quite fun! Although I did get a spider bite... (hence the subject line) The spider bite has been one of the most exciting aspects of our week. My left ankle was swollen like a balloon and terribly itchy. I talked to our mission nurse and she told me to ice it, but on cortisone cream, raise my leg while sitting, and take Benadryl at night and my spider bite has gotten a lot better!
                    <br><br>
                    On Tuesday we had a devotional from Elder Mckay who is in our Area presidency. His talk was really good! We read in Doctrine and Covenants 59:21 about how the wrath of God is kindled against those who don't confess his hand in all things.
                    <br><br>
                    Elder Mckay explained that God does not CAUSE all things (though he may allow things to happen) but his hand is IN all things. He said "No matter where we are or how we got there, God's hand is always there to steady us, strengthen us, and ultimately deliver us." And we just need to REACH for his hand!
                    <br><br>
                    On Friday we had a devotional from the Prophet's daughter. She and her husband talked about President Nelson from their perspective. Sadly, we were only able to watch about half an hour of it because we had a lesson with a former named Gary. We did end up finding Gary so the lesson was not a complete bust. In fact, we found 3 people in one day on Friday! Gary, Benjamin, and Ivory! They all seem to be quite interested in our message. Benjamin was a special find because we actually called what we thought was someone else's number and Benjamin picked up and when we told him we were missionaries he was actually interested in hearing what we had to say! And he speaks Spanish so that's doubly special!
                    <br><br>
                    Also on Friday, for movie night, we watched "Out of Liberty". It was quite a crazy movie. There were a lot of events in that movie that I didn't even know happened! 
                    <br><br>
                    Hermana Crookston and I also had our interview with President this week. They were through Facebook Messenger. President asked me if I'd be interested in being the Social Media Specialist for the mission! I said yes! He said there are still some things that need to be worked out and I'll have to be trained but I'm excited to work in that calling. The Social Media Specialist is over all of the Facebook Pages in the mission and conducts training, research, and handles the advertisements for Facebook pages for the mission. My area doesn't have a Facebook page yet... But we did get a new video editing application this week and that has been fun to play around with!
                    <br><br>
                    On Sunday, Hermana Crookston and I studied the Come, Follow Me chapter for the week. I thought it was REALLY good. I honestly am in love with the Book of Mormon and Alma is literally the coolest. Both the old one and the young one. We watched the Book of Mormon video for when Alma the Younger gets smitten by the angel and it was awesome. I'd invite you all to watch it! It's about 11 minutes long.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    I am almost done with the Book of Mormon again! I started reading in 1 Nephi when I was on the plane to Houston and now I am in Moroni 9! I honestly love the Book of Mormon and it is so interesting and has so much power!! And it truly is the keystone of our religion. If the Book of Mormon was not true, we wouldn't have a religion. Good thing it for sure is true!!
                    <br><br>
                    One last scripture I'd like to share. 1 John 4:7-9
                    <br><br>
                    7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
                    <br><br>
                    8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
                    <br><br>
                    9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him
                    <br><br>
                    Truly we have this life and our savior and the Book of Mormon and a living prophet because GOD LOVES US! I am continually amazed by his love. 
                    <br><br>
                    Love you all, looking forward to hearing how you've been :)
                    <br><br><br>
