                    Hola familia y amigos! 
                    <br><br>
                    Yes I'm still here in Houston! Even some of the members in our ward think that we all got sent home. Sometimes I wish that were true lol but I'd be stuck inside doing nothing if I were at home too. 
                    <br><br>
                    This week was pretty eventful! We had a devotional by Andy Reid (some football dude, maybe someone knows him)
                    We also had a devotional from Brad Wilcox!!!! I love Brad Wilcox. I took Doctrines and Teachings of the Book of Mormon from him in the Fall semester and it was the only lecture I actually looked forward to attending. We have all our devotionals over Zoom and President Guthrie asked for people to send in videos of them singing a verse of a hymn to play as the musical number in devotionals. My companions and I sent in us singing "Mas Cerca Dios De Ti" and president played it for the Brad Wilcox devotional! And Brother Wilcox used it in his talk. He said that that was the song that they sang on the Titanic, the "unsinkable ship" and he talked about how the world is sinking right now but we're on the life boats. (Hence the subject line) 
                    <br><br>
                    We also had interviews with President this week. We had them on Friday, the day of the worldwide fast. We started our fast on Wednesday after lunch so we could eat lunch on Friday. We drove to the mission home and Sister Guthrie made us lettuce wraps and quesadillas while we took turns for interviews. The lettuce wraps were most specifically for Hermana Rich because she's trying to do Keto. I am not. I believe carbs are a necessary nutrient somehow lol. 
                    My interview with President went well. Hermana Rich told us the night before that we could ask him for a priesthood blessing so I did.
                    <br><br>
                    The hardest things for me right now are being stuck inside and not knowing when I'll leave and missing my boyfriend. I don't even miss my mom and dad (sorry mom)  since I get to call them 2 times a week while we're in isolation. 
                    <br><br>
                    Yesterday was Easter!! Happy Easter! We taught a ton of lessons yesterday about Easter, specifically the resurrection,  on video calls. Someone sent Hermana Rich a plate of dried fruit but no one knows who it was... Today we're going to buy discount Easter candy at Walmart. üòÅ
                    <br><br>
                    This week is the last week of the transfer! And as of last Friday I've been on the mission for a month! To me it feels like way longer than that. It's hard to think about how much longer I have! 
                    <br><br>
                    How's everyone? What do you do all day? 
                    <br><br>
