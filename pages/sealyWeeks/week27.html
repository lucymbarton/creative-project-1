                  Buenos dias!
                  <br><br>
                   This week was FULL of miracles! :)
                   <br><br>
                   We have been teaching a woman named Faith who was actually a referral  from another lady Katrina that we are teaching. We have been meeting  with Faith almost every day and just teach her one principle at a  time. She texted us this week and told her that she has been to Temple  Square with one of her coworkers who has 6 sons who all went to BYU  and served missions. Faith seems really interested in coming closer to  God and learning about our church!! Too bad she lives in Minnesota and  we'll have to send her to missionaries up there.
                   <br><br>
                   On Tuesday we drove about half an hour into the middle of nowhere to  give some brownies to a member family that we've been trying to get in  contact with. Google maps took us down a dirt road that eventually  lead to a "private" railroad crossing and a gated road! I wasn't sure  if it was legal to cross the railroad without "permission from  owner"... so I parked the truck and we got out and walked over the  tracks to try and figure out if we could open the gate. It needed a  code. We were still half a mile from this family's house! We called  the Father and the Mother and neither answered. We were just about to  crawl under the gate and walk the last half a mile when I just tried  to punch "1, 2, 3, 4" into the keypad and... THE GATE OPENED!!
                   <br><br>
                   "It's the will of God!!" I said and we ran back to the truck and drove  across the tracks and through the gate. But that's not even it! We  kept driving down this dirt road and we made it to a cattle guard. On  the other side of the cattle guard were a ton of cows and some were  just laying in the road so we decided to get out of the car and walk  the rest of the way. But we weren't sure if the cows were going to  charge us or something so we walked really slow... Then we saw this  man named Luis who showed us where the Garcia Family's house was. We  talked to their daughter on the porch. Then we tried to share the  gospel with Luis but he really likes his own religion and says there's  no time in this country to read books.
                   <br><br>
                   On Wednesday we were supposed to have District Council but the ZLs  weren't able to make it all the way out here to Sealy. So we had an  hour and a half free. We decided to go out and drop a large print Book  of Mormon off at Leila's house. She lives in a big trailer park. So we  decided to just go on a little walk around and we found FIVE people!  They all gave us their numbers and everything. And they all speak  Spanish!!! It was amazing.
                   <br><br>
                   The new rule about being able to teach in people's homes is amazing.  We were able to share a message with Bishop's family and with the  Ibarra family. I also got to help the Ibarra's son with his math  homework. It felt soo good to do math again!! The numberline and  fractions and rational numbers :) Maybe I'm going crazy or maybe I've  only been studying the Gospel and Spanish for the past 6 months.
                   <br><br>
                   Speaking of that... I hit 6 months as a missionary this last Friday!!!  I will be home in less than a year!! That is crazy to know! To  celebrate we went and got some yummy food from the Knights of Columbus  drive through.
                   <br><br>
                   We had a devotional on Tuesday from a recent convert who used to be a  Baptist preacher! It was so awesome. After the devotional I decided I  want to read the entire bible cover to cover. I'm already in Genesis!  I'm loving the musical vibes lol. Joseph AND The Prince of Egypt. :)
                   <br><br>
                   Hermana Cannefax and I have been obsessed with the song "Danny Boy"  sung by BYU Vocal Point this week. We've probably listened to it about  25-30 times this week. So we decided to name our truck Danny.
                   <br><br>
                   Spiritual Thought:
                   <br><br>
                   Alma 26:37
                   <br><br>
                   37 Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people,  whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his  bowels of mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my  great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever. Amen.
                   <br><br>
                   God is really mindful of EVERY people! He knows all of us and every  circumstance. I have been able to see this this week when our plans  have fallen through but we have still been able to find people and  have meaningful contacts with so many people!
                   <br><br>
                   I love our Heavenly Father. I love His plan for us. I love Jesus  Christ and I know that He lives!
                   <br><br><br>
