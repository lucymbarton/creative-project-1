                  Buenos dias!
                  <br><br>
                   This week was eventful.
                   <br><br>
                   On Tuesday the Tropical Storm Beta came through at it rained literally alllll day long and we weren't allowed to leave. We were supposed to have our Zone Conference on Tuesday so we didn't have any lessons scheduled and it was sooo boring. Our Zone Conference was postponed to Wednesday so we had to cancel or move all the lessons that we scheduled on Wednesday. Kinda annoying but it was alright.
                   <br><br>
                  
                   Our Zone Conference theme was "Field of Dreams" based off of the baseball movie. We had Zone Conference in the Minute-Maid stadium downtown. It was soooo cool! There were some members from our stake in attendance that gave us some good feedback on how to best work with members.
                   <br><br>
                   On Friday we decided to go drop something off at a referral's house who hasn't responded to our texts and this lady lives in the middle of nowhere with her parents in this big house on a ton of land and they have a pool. We asked her if she remembered sending her information to us. She said "Yeah... But I didn't know what I was doing." It was kinda funny. We gave her a Book of Mormon and set a time to come back next week. Maybe she'll get baptized in her pool.
                   <br><br>
                   Saturday sucked a lot. We ran out of things to do and I felt so bored and so frustrated. We decided to try something new and go and talk to people at GoodWill but for some reason there was barely anyone there on a Saturday at 6:30. And the people we did talk to were really not into it.
                   <br><br>
                   We went and ran 2 miles at the park and then I just cried to Hermana Cannefax and said "I don't even like being a missionary!!" She said "Keep crying!! Maybe someone will feel bad for us and get baptized in your tears!"
                   <br><br>
                   Anyways. That kinda sucked but then we talked to this really nice lady and her kids at the park. But then we went home and got a call from our Ward Mission Leader and some member who works at GoodWill had texted him and told him to tell us that we shouldn't talk to people at GoodWill. Kinda awkward. And Like why didn't she just tell us that while we were there to our faces? Anyways I cried like all night. And then our Bishop texted and asked me if I could speak in church the next day. It was pretty awful.
                   <br><br>
                   Sunday was good. I shared a spiritual message in our second session of sacrament meeting about the Book of Mormon. It was pretty good. But only like 3 people were there... RIP
                   <br><br>
                   We found a butt ton of people out in Brookshire and Pattison again this week. But all of our people who we expected to come to church are sick or waiting COVID tests. :(
                    <br><br>
                   I miss y'all and I miss Costa Vida and watching TV...
                   <br><br>
                   BIG NEWS:
                   <br><br>
                   President called us last night and asked if we would TRAIN a new missionary coming in on Tuesday!!!! So Hermana Cannefax and I will be training a new Hermana!! IDK how we're going to fit three beds in our bedroom but we'll see what we can do.
                   <br><br>
                   Spiritual Thought:
                   <br><br>
                   I've been reading the New Testament and honestly it's sooo boring because I'm just reading about all the rules in the law of Moses. I was thinking about how hard it would be to live the law of Moses, but in Come Follow Me this week it said that when Christ fulfilled the law of Moses, He instituted a higher law. Hermana Cannefax said that the law of Moses kinda forced people to remember Christ because they had to sacrifice animals for like literally every thing but under the new law we have to willingly choose every day to remember Christ. Kinda interesting!
                   <br><br>
                   Love y'all
                   <br><br><br>
