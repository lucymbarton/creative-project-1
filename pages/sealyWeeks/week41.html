                  Buenos Dias!
                  <br><br>
                   This week was pretty good! Thanks for all of the birthday wishes
                   yesterday! My birthday turned out to be an awesome day!!
                   <br><br>
                   Last Monday we played pickleball with the district.
                   <br><br>
                   Tuesday we taught a recent convert Annie and we had a WhatsApp video
                   call with a man named Naul Rodriguez that we have been messaging on
                   Facebook for a while. The elders found him, but he only speaks
                   Spanish. He lives in Costa Rica, but he still hasn't sent us his
                   address...
                   <br><br>
                   Wednesday we had district council! We all went around and shared some
                   miracles or tender mercies that we have seen this year in our lives. I
                   was like "This year sucked!" lol but the biggest miracle that happened
                   to me this year is that I actually came on my mission! I'm so glad
                   that I decided to serve.
                   <br><br>
                   Also on Wednesday we went out and shared the Christ Child video with
                   the Martinez family! They loved it. Then they gave us some chicken and
                   lettuce and pico and chips and tortillas and cookies. :)
                   <br><br>
                   Thursday we went out to Denny's and taught Ruth the Restoration of the
                   gospel of Jesus Christ. She liked it. We invited her to read the
                   introduction of the Book of Mormon and 1 Nephi 1 and pray about it.
                   <br><br>
                   Friday was awful. We were going to teach this new couple that we found
                   on Facebook Summer and Deven. We had shared the Christ Child with them
                   last week and then we talked afterwards and set another time to meet
                   with them! We were planning on teaching the Restoration, but Deven
                   gave us a scripture to read, 2 Timothy 2:22-26. We read it and we
                   thought it was nice, but when we got on the call with him he was like
                   "The snare of the Devil means religion because Jesus hates religion!"
                   And he just kept going off about how we worship the devil because we
                   are part of an organized religion. We weren't arguing with him, but we
                   started trying to explain what we believe but he just wasn't there to
                   learn anything lol. Eventually I said "I'm sorry, but we're going to
                   have to end this call because nothing edifying is happening." and he
                   said "You're trying to control the end of this call, but I'm going to
                   say that you need to go pray to God and ask if God told you to leave
                   your religion, would you?" And then he hung up. I mean it was kinda
                   funny but it was also just terrifying. Hermana Oveson and I just cried
                   and called Sister Guthrie.
                   <br><br>
                   The next day, I went through and read all of 1 and 2 Timothy to see if
                   I could figure out where this guy was coming from, and and could see
                   how he could get confused when Paul is talking about people who would
                   teach false doctrines and apostize, but what was kinda funny is the
                   verses that he told us to read were actually about how you shouldn't
                   bible bash with people lol. I really liked reading 1 and 2 Timothy! It
                   talked about how we are all going to pass through tribulation, but
                   that we should hold on to what we already know and remember all the
                   witnesses that we have received. And the entire two books are
                   literally Paul telling Timothy how he can magnify his calling as a
                   leader in Christ's Church (aka, religion) . So I just don't understand
                   how people think that Jesus hates religion...
                   <br><br>
                   Anyways
                   <br><br>
                   Saturday we went to the library to help with an event they were doing
                   for kids but no one came... so we told the elders and they told a lady
                   that they're teaching Lareeta and then Lareeta came! Later, we went
                   over to Bishop's house and helped them go through pictures that
                   they're going to scan into Family Search.
                   <br><br>
                   Sunday was my birthday! It was awesome!! We had ward council at 7am,
                   then church. We had 2 sessions of sacrament meeting. Hermana Oveson
                   and I sang Noche de Luz (Silent Night). Then, we got a ride from
                   Hermana Velasquez to Ven Sigueme at the Ibarra's. We taught the class,
                   then they had food for us. Tamales!!! and they had a cake for me and
                   they sang and I blew out a candle! They gave me a whole bunch of
                   chocolate for my birthday. They're so nice. Elder Satterfield made me
                   some sweet pork so then I made some sweet pork nachos. He also
                   crocheted me a blanket! It's a pretty good blanket. My parents got me
                   literally everything I ever wanted for my birthday so idk what they
                   got me for Christmas.
                   <br><br>
                   Spiritual thought:
                   <br><br>
                   2 Timothy 1:7-8
                   <br><br>
                   7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
                   love, and of a sound mind.
                   8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
                   me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel
                   according to the power of God;
                   <br><br>
                   We do not need to fear or be ashamed of believing in Jesus Christ or
                   in the restored gospel. As we partake of the "afflictions of the
                   gospel", we will learn and grow as we come closer to Christ and
                   progress toward eternal glory.
                   <br><br>
                   Les quiero
                   <br><br>
                   Love yall!!
                   <br><br><br>
