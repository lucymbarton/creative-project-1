                    Buenos días mis amigos! 
                    <br><br>
                    Cómo están?
                    <br><br>
                    This week was another week living in the middle of the middle of nowhere. 
                    <br><br>
                    On last Monday we met with a man in the church named Adrián. He and his family have been going through A LOT but that means they're ready to find some peace and happiness in the gospel!! And he speaks Spanish!!
                    <br><br>
                    Tuesday we had another devotional with Hank Smith! He talked about the Holy Ghost and how we can tell when we are feeling it. It was really good. Basically if we ever just want to be good people or want to tell the truth or be nice then THAT'S the Holy Ghost talking to us! Pretty cool. 
                    <br><br>
                    Wednesday was Hermana West's 9 month mark! To celebrate we went to this burger place nearby called Trump Burger. It was actually really yummy. Also on Wednesday we got a referral from a man Lucino and we went and dropped off a libro at his house. His house looked really nice and he had some horses that Hermana West pet.
                    <br><br>
                    Thursday we saw a miracle. We wanted to throw in some laundry while we did weekly planning, but quarters are still a problem. I had prayed a few weeks back that God would help us find quarters and this week on Thursday we found a whole dollar worth of quarters!!! 2 on the ground, 1 in a washing machine, and 1 in the change spot of the vending machine! It was a miracle. 
                    <br><br>
                    This whole week we have been trying to find people on Facebook and we actually had some success!!! We asked a woman named Helen if she wanted to hear a message about Jesus Christ and she said yes!!! And then we called her and shared John 3:16 and she wants to meet again on Tuesday! 
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual thought
                    <br><br>
                    Alma 18:35
                    <br><br>
                    35 And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which are in God.
                    <br><br>
                    The gift of the Holy Ghost is powerful!!! No wonder it is a commandment to be baptized because when we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we literally have a member of the Godhead with us as our constant companion! On my mission I have been able to learn more about how I feel the influence of the Holy Ghost and how I can recognize personal revelation. 
                    <br><br>
                    Ps. the subject line is a Spanish phrase that means "don't cry over spilt milk" but literally translates to "chest out at what has already been done." 
                    <br><br>
                    Love y'all 
                    <br><br><br>
