                  Buenos dias familiares y amigos!
                  <br><br>
                   The P-days just keep on coming.
                   <br><br>
                   Last Monday Hermana Cannefax and I went out to Katy and did our  laundry and some shopping at Target and Bath and Body Works. I got  some hand sanitizer and a cute pink sparkley hand sanitizer holder  which I was really excited about.
                   <br><br>
                   Tuesday, Hermana Cannefax made us a chicken pot pie for lunch. Then we  drove out to Eagle Lake to give some members some letters. We like to  drive because that means we can listen to music!
                   <br><br>
                   Wednesday, we went up to Brother Turner's house and replanted some  plants called Wandering Jews in his neighbor's yard. Brother Turner  just wanted an excuse to introduce his neighbors to the missionaries  lol. It was fun and they are nice people.
                   <br><br>
                   Thursday we got news that our mission is going into Phase 1 of COVID  precautions! This means that we can teach in member's houses and the  houses of people that we are teaching by invitation and that we will  be able to have missionary meetings like Zone Conference in person!!!  I think that we will still be teaching mostly online, but I am excited  for Zone Conference in person! Zone Conference on Zoom is always soooo  long and my butt hurts from just sitting looking at my screen the  whole time.
                   <br><br>
                   On Friday we had a bible study with our friend Katrina and we talked  about what it means to "Be Still". She really wants to grow closer to  God since she has gotten consistent in her exercise habits and now  wants to strengthen her spiritual habits. She is awesome! Turns out  that she knows Brother Turner since he taught her son how to play  chess! She also used to take lessons from the missionaries for 6-12  months a few years ago. She said she'd be open to talking about the  Book of Mormon again!! I am excited for Katrina.
                   <br><br>
                   On Saturday we went up to Bellville to the Farmers Market. It was so  fun and so cute. We talked to a few people and handed out some pamphlets.
                   <br><br>
                   This week we actually found 5 new people to teach! We have been  teaching some men who live near our complex and 3 of those men we  found last week. But we will be giving them to the elders so they can  teach them without needing a third adult of the same gender present.
                   <br><br>
                   Spiritual Thought:
                   <br><br>
                   Alma 32:10-12
                   <br><br>
                   10 Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God  save it be in your synagogues only?
                   11 And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship  God only once in a week?
                   12 I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues,  that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it is  necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are  cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your  exceeding poverty, that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye  are necessarily brought to be humble.
                   <br><br>
                   We shared these verses with our friend Anthony this week. He is  convinced that the churches are closed for a reason and he has been  studying the bible with his wife in his home during this whole  pandemic. We shared this with him and he really liked it! We actually  might have interested him enough to read some of the Book of Mormon to  know for himself!
                   <br><br>
                   Truly we can worship God where ever we are. And we can remember that  the times when things are going the worst are just times that we can  be the humblest and reach out to God!
                   <br><br>
                   I promise that God hears and answers prayers, he loves you, and he  knows you more than you know yourself!
                   <br><br>
                   Les quiero
                   <br><br><br>
