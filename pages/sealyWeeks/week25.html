                  Hola y buenos dias!
                  <br><br>
                   Last monday at 5:00 I got my new companion! Her name is Hermana Cannefax and she is from Riverton, Utah! She served 11 months in the Dominican Republic before being sent home when COVID happened and then being reassigned to the THSM! She is beautiful and loves to talk to people outside. And her Spanish is great!
                   <br><br>
                   The drive back from the mission office was sketchy as Google Maps decided to take us on the Farm to Market roads instead of the Freeway. But turns out that there was a 5 car pile up westbound on the I-10. And that's why we were driving in the middle of nowhere to get to the middle of nowhere lol.
                   <br><br>
                   Since Hermana Cannefax loves talking to people so much, we've made a lot of friends with people who live in our apartment complex this week. Some of them we might even start teaching!
                   <br><br>
                   So we were supposed to get a hurricane on Thursday morning. Hurricane Laura was making landfall and was a catagory 4 hurricane. Hermana Cannefax and I got a whole bunch of water, filled up a ton of our containers with water AND the bathtub with water. We got a bunch of canned food and we were prepared to eat Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the next week if necessary. AND we parked our car at the church in case our parking lot flooded. I woke up at 2am on Thursday morning waiting to hear thunder or wind or anything. There was nothing. It didn't even rain here in Sealy. I was only a little bit disappointed. But that's the second hurricane that was headed straight for us and hasn't hit us.
                   <br><br>
                   We finally got to have a lesson with a referral named Lucino. He said he read the introduction to the Book of Mormon and that it was unlike any other book he'd ever read. We taught him the Restoration. The next day we called and he said he didn't "think being a Mormon was right for him because there's too many rules. Like we can't smoke, drink, dance, or listen to music." And we were like "well first of all we're not mormons. And second of all only half of those are true."
                   <br><br>
                   We had church again this week. None of our people came but we got Lucino to join a lesson with the Ibarra family.
                   <br><br>
                   Spiritual thought:
                   <br><br>
                   Mosiah 27:29
                   <br><br>
                   29 My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.
                   <br><br>
                   Every time I read about Alma the younger I am amazed by his story more and more. In Come Follow Me this week we learned about how we shouldn't base our testimony on signs. The reason is because when we are given signs we still have our agency to chose whether to regect the sign or not. If we reject it (like Laman and Lemuel who saw an angel and still murmured) we will be worse off than if we had not believed without a sign.
                   <br><br>
                   Alma the Younger saw an angel and had a marvelous repentance experience and then decided he needed to go and share the gospel with all the land. How amazing.9
                   <br><br>
                   Love yall.
                   <br><br><br>
                   Hermana Barton
