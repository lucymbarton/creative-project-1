                  Buenos dias!
                  <br><br>
                  This week was one of the longest weeks of my life!! I can't believe that it was only last week that we said goodbye to Hermana Cannefax.
                  <br><br>
                  Our week started out just weird. It's weird to just be two again. And it's really quiet without Hermana Cannefax. She talked a lot. 
                  <br><br>
                  Tuesday the Zone Leaders wanted us to drive out to bring them our extra bed. So we did. And then on the way back there was a crash on the I-10 that caused us to sit, parked, on the freeway for an hour and a half. It was pretty nice lol. I texted President right after we put the truck in park because it was like 8:40 and I was like "Yeah... we're parked on I-10 right now... We're not going to make it home by 9:30 tonight." He just said "let me know when you make it home!" We made it home at 10:25 pm. RIP
                  <br><br>
                  Wednesday was district council! It was weird. Elder Whorley is our new Zone Leader. He used to be Assistant to the President so everyone is scared of him. The District chat is not very fun anymore. We got rejected by one of our friends while we were in district council and the elders told us that Rachel said she doesn't think she's ready to change. So I went out to the truck and cried after district council lol. Elder Satterfield made us some more cookies. 
                  <br><br>
                  We were able to find 6 new people to teach this week! 
                  <br><br>
                  On Friday we went over to our friends Jesus and Elvia's house with Brother Wagner and Brother Bolten from our ward who speak Spanish and they gave Jesus a blessing! It was so special!! He said that the blessing made him feel good inside and that he felt like he had more strength!! We will be going back to their house next Wednesday to teach them some more.
                  <br><br>
                  Saturday we bought some papusas from a couple who sells them off the side of the 90. They were literally one of the best things I have ever eaten in my whole life. Only 2 dollars and they do it every Saturday! Their names are David and Teresa and they speak Spanish!! We will definitely be going back again.
                  <br><br>
                  Sunday we got Ruth to church!!!!! It was so amazing! Brother and Sister Brown gave her a ride. Brother Brown spoke in our meeting about having gratitude in our trials. Ruth really liked it. She said she felt very peaceful and she liked meeting all the people there. I think that a December 25th baptism for Ruth would be very beautiful. :)
                  <br><br>
                  I hope that you all got a chance to watch the Message of Hope from our prophet Russel M. Nelson. We shared it with some of our neighbors (who are devoutly Baptist) and they really liked it. We got into a conversation about how apostles and prophets should have the right authority. We asked him what he means when he says he's "saved" or "born again" and he said that when the word enters your heart you get a little bit of faith and it's a supernatural experience and eventually the word starts spilling out your mouth and you're saved. Ok.
                  <br><br>
                  Spiritual thought:
                  <br><br>
                  Alma 34:38
                  38 That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.
                  <br><br>
                  I have loved focusing on being thankful in this season! Truly we have God to thank for everything that we have!
                  <br><br>
                  Love y'all
                  <br><br>
                  les quiero
                  <br><br><br>
