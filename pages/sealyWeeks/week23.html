                    Buenos días familiares y amigos!
                    <br><br>
                     Last p day we went biking in Katy in the middle of the day and it was  so hot but so fun to actually be with other people lol. I have the  worst farmers tan and watch tan line.
                     <br><br>
                     On Tuesday I hit my 5 month mark!!! I can't believe it's already been  that long. To celebrate we went to this little Mexican shop and I got  a mangonada! It was so yummy.
                     <br><br>
                     Also on Tuesday we had a devotional with Coach Pope from BYU  Basketball and he talked about the importance of being obedient every  day and how trials strengthen and change us and how we should always  use the word "yet" if we're gonna talk negatively.
                     <br><br>
                     On Wednesday we had district council and the ZLs brought us little  apple pies from Bucee's. They were so yummy. (But the Bucees in Katy  is actually outside our mission and the ZLs didn't realize it lol)
                     <br><br>
                     We helped a new family move in to our ward and they have the MOST  board games I have ever seen. And half of them were unopened boxes of  Monopoly. Hermana West and I just couldn't figure out who needs that  many Juegos de la mesa.
                     <br><br>
                     We drove over to Columbus on Thursday to get a change of scenery for  weekly planning and also to drop off some Books of Mormon. We drove  over the Colorado river!!! I thought that was so cool. Only a few  thousand miles upriver is Utah!
                     <br><br>
                     On Friday we drove down to Eagle Lake and gave out some more Books of  Mormon. We were trying to find trailer number 17 for like 20 minutes  and it was just about 100 degrees outside and it was miserable. And  trailer 18 didnt even exist.
                     <br><br>
                     For movie night we watched the first episode of "The Chosen"
                     <br><br>
                     On Saturday we had a Zone call on Zoom and played a game called  "Dieter or Dumbledore" and you had to read a quote and say whether  Elder Uchtdorf or Albus Dumbledore said it. I won.
                     <br><br>
                     On Sunday, President Guthrie came all the way out to Sealy for our  interviews! We cleaned the apartment like crazy. But I ended up having  my interview at the church anyways since we had to head over there for  the first sacrament meeting in Sealy since March!
                     <br><br>
                     We ended up having 3 sessions of sacrament with less than 50 people at  each session and we cleaned everything between them all. Bishop Ramsey  and his family are so sweet and brought us sandwiches to eat for helping.
                     <br><br>
                     This week is the last week of the transfer!! This transfer has gone by  so fast. I'll let you know next week if anyone around me is leaving  but we think that Hermana West and I will probably both stay here in  Sealy for another transfer.
                     <br><br>
                     Spiritual thought:
                     <br><br>
                     2 Nephi 26:24
                     <br><br>
                     24 He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for  he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may  draw all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall  not partake of his salvation.
                     <br><br>
                     I think this verse describes very well the love and nature of Jesus  Christ towards us. We are all invited to partake of His salvation and  to feel of his love and recieve forgiveness of our sins.
                     <br><br>
                     I know that Jesus Christ is near me every day. When I first came to  Houston, President Guthrie told me that as a missionary I'd be able to  feel the Savior beside me more than at any time of my life. I didn't  really think much of it. But now I can testify. I know that the Savior  of the world works alongside me. I can feel Him near me every second  of the day and night. I know He loves me and I love Him.
                     <br><br>
                     D&C 26:32
                     <br><br>
                     32 Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said unto my disciples, where  two or three are gathered together in my name, as touching one thing,  behold, there will I be in the midst of them—even so am I in the midst  of you.
                     <br><br>
                     Que tengan una buena semana ❤
                     <br><br><br>
