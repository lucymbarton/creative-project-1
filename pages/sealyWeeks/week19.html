                    Buenos dÃ­as y feliz dÃ­a de preparaciÃ³n! 
                    <br><br>
                    How are y'all doing? 
                    <br><br>
                    I am doing well in my new area of Sealy! (Population 6019) There are a bunch of ranches with cows and horses and chickens here and we are really living in the country! 
                    <br><br>
                    On Tuesday we went to our ward mission leader's house to do some service. Our ward mission leader is Brother Turner and he is the man who painted the painting of the missionaries walking down the road with angels walking with them! He had a bunch of really good paintings on his walls and next time we go over I'll get to see his studio! But while we were there their AC was broken along with their hot water and their water well. It was rather crazy. And we were helping empty out an RV for a couple who is living in an apartment on the side of their house. 
                    <br><br>
                    We have gone and tried to drop off Book of Mormons to some formers and a referral this week but none of that worked very well, although it was nice to get to drive around and see our area. 
                    <br><br>
                    Hermana West and I decided to try and make a cute Facebook video by doing a time lapse of us putting together a puzzle, and we didnt think it would take too long but our 500 piece Jesus puzzle really took us a couple of days to finish ðŸ˜… and the video quality is quite iffy. 
                    <br><br>
                    There are not many Spanish speakers in our English/Spanish ward but we are trying our best to find opportunities to use our Spanish. We taught Come Follow Me on Zoom this Sunday for the Spanish speakers of the ward. (Although only one family showed up) And I learned the Spanish word for "to compell" (obligar).
                    <br><br>
                    One of the Elders in our complex, Elder Satterfield, loves to cook and bake so he brought us a crab quiche and a cheese cake and some fudge this week. He's really going to fatten us up. 
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual thought: 
                    <br><br>
                    3 Nephi 1:20
                    <br><br>
                    20 And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, according to the words of the prophets.
                    <br><br>
                    I was reading this story last week and it struck me how awesome the story is. The wicked people said that if the sign of a day and a night and a day without darkness did not come that they would kill all the believers. Nephi prayed all day and into the night, struck with much worry. The voice of the Lord came unto him and told him not to worry "for on the morrow come I into the world" (3 nephi 1:13) and truly everything that the prophets had declared would happen came to pass! And that's why it is so important to listen to prophets in our day as well! I know that our prophet President Russell M. Nelson has been called of God and receives revelations especially for our day. 
                    <br><br>
                    Love you all and hope your week is great! Let me know how your summer has been so far! 
                    <br><br><br>
