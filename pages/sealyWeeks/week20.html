                    Buenos d√≠as!! Est√° semana estuvo bien y loco!!
                    <br><br>
                     My companion and I bought matching shirts at Walmart which was fun!
                     <br><br>
                     On Wednesday we taught 6 lessons!! Usually it is hard to get 3 so 6 is  really good! We found a lady named Betty this week but turns out she  doesn't want to get baptized ever so that sucks.
                     <br><br>
                     I got another spider bite this week... but I just took some benadryl  and it got better!
                     <br><br>
                     We only had 1 lesson on Thursday and all the other ones we had set  fell through. The lesson was with a lady named Leila and she speaks  Spanish! We taught her the Plan of Salvation! She really liked it. My  companion has been having troubles with some back pain so she was  laying on the ground and Leila went off talking about how her pastor  never checks up on her and I had to listen really hard to understand  what she was saying but I did it! And I finished up the lesson all by  myself! El don de lenguas really comes in clutch sometimes!
                     <br><br>
                     We don't have a washer and dryer in our apartment but our complex has  a laundry room, you just need quarters. And it has been soooo hard to  find quarters since there is a coin shortage in the US right now... We  have to go to a bunch of stores and beg for quarters like homeless  people just to do our laundry.
                     <br><br>
                     My companion almost died this week! She took a muscle relaxer before  bed and then it relaxed her muscles so much that she stopped  breathing. Luckily when she couldn't breathe she woke up and woke me  up. Nurse Andersen and I agree that maybe she shouldn't take those  anymore.
                     <br><br>
                     Hurricane Hannah only barely got us in Sealy. We got some rain and  some cloudy skies and that was it. I was looking forward to a nice  storm but didn't see much.
                     <br><br>
                     That's about all this week. We have been teaching a lot of members and  inviting them to like our Facebook page. We got a Book of Mormon to  our friend Jessica and we gave a picture book Book of Mormon to her  daughter. We hope they like them!
                     <br><br>
                     Spiritual thought:
                     <br><br>
                     Mormon 9: 27
                     <br><br>
                     27 O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken unto the words of  the Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things  soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin  as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and  work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him.
                     <br><br>
                     Somehow I have overlooked this verse the other times I have read  through Mormon! But I am almost done with the Book of Mormon again and  I read this verse this week. I think it is really powerful. We  shouldn't doubt, but we should believe in God and come unto Him with  ALL our heart and we can "reason together" (Isaiah 1:18) and work out  our salvation. And then we can have the joy and happiness promised by  Alma in Alma 36!! I love the Book of Mormon. :)
                     <br><br>
                     Oh yeah and last Monday we attended the baptism of an 8-year-old in  our ward who was baptized in a pool in the backyard of one of our  members. It was very very beautiful (see pics)
                     <br><br>
                     Love you all!
                     <br><br>
                     If you are looking for a way to serve the Lord's servant, hit me up  for my address and maybe you can send me a Walmart giftcard... üòè
