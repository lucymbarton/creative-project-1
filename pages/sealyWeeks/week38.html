                  Buenos dias a todos
                  <br><br>
                   Como estan?

                   This week was weird with the holiday. Also it rained a lot. And we  went over our alloted miles in the truck. We got our friend Erlinda to  "church." That's the big stuff!
                   <br><br>
                   P day was boring last week since everybody was out of miles and  couldn't hang out. Honestly they should give us more miles since the  only reason we're using them is to do missionary work... but it's  fine. Rumors are going around that Texas is going to shut down with  COVID again and if that happens we won't need any of our miles!
                   <br><br>
                   Tuesday we went out to Wallis to help our recent convert Melody clean  out some of her shelves. She is going to be moving soon but not very  far. She only has one leg and loves to talk! It was good service for  her because I think she gets lonely in her little house. Her husband  is a truck driver and is barely home!
                   <br><br>
                   Wednesday we had a lesson with Erlinda! It went really well and I  could understand almost everything she said! We were really able to  teach to her needs and listen to her concerns! She commited to listen  to church! Which is kinda weird because the Zoom of our church is in  English so there's not really a way for Spanish speaking people to  watch church online... so we just called Erlinda on our phone and gave  it to Brother Bolten who was translating for the Spanish speaking  people who were at church that day (The Sanchezs and always only the  Sanchezs who only speak Spanish)
                   <br><br>
                   We had four lessons in a row planned on Wednesday evening, but only  one of them happened. But we found a new friend named Mirna and the  lady in the Elote truck asked for a pamphlet and gave us free elote!  Elote is just corn with mayonaise, cheese, chile sauce, and lemon. It  was good for the first few bites but then it was just too much lol.
                   <br><br>
                   We taught the Restoration to Jesus, Elvia, Rosa, and the rest of the  Medrano family. It was a new experience for me! I have never taught a  family that big in person and I had no idea how to teach to all of  their needs at the same time. Next time we go over will be better. We  had a member there on the phone but it would be better to have a  member there in person I think.
                   <br><br>
                   Thanksgiving was super fun! In the morning we went to Brother Turner's  house and we helped him plant some carrots! He gave us 4 rotisserie  chickens and two fat pies from costco. We met up with our district at  the church. Hermana Oveson and I brought stuffing, yams, rolls, and  pumpkin chocolate chip cookies! Elder Worley made a turkey and Elder  Satterfield made mashed potatoes and homemade beef gravy. It was all  pretty good. But we had to eat at a table in the parking lot of the  church and there were a lot of bugs. And it was weird. The people  driving by probably thinks that we are really weird lol. That night  the bishop's family invited us over for pie and sat in the backyard  and ate some pie and talked about what we're thankful for. Pretty good  day.
                   <br><br>
                   Saturday we helped Sister Ramsey get her Christmas tree fluffed and  other decorations started. We stayed in Brookshire all day to save  miles and then we tried to knock on Avainia's door with Giselle (a  member who is her friend) but she wasn't home. But we had a good talk  with Giselle! She is going on a mission soon!
                   <br><br>
                   Como estan ustedes? How was everyone's Thanksgiving?
                   <br><br>
                   Spiritual Thought:
                   <br><br>
                   Moroni 10:7
                   <br><br>
                   7 And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost;  wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he  worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men, the  same today and tomorrow, and forever.
                   <br><br>
                   God works by power according to our faith! We are able to develop our  faith every time that we try to come closer to God! I invite you all  to act in faith this week and wait to see the arm of God revealed in  your life!
                   <br><br>
                   Les quiero
                   <br><br>
                   love yall
                   <br><br><br>
