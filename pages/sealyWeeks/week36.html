                  Buenos Dias otra vez!
                  <br><br>
                  This week was Hermana Cannefax's last week as a missionary! Kinda bitter-sweet. But we had some fire lessons! Hermana Cannefax definitely went out with a bang.
                  <br><br>
                  Last monday we played pickleball with the district again. We went and got our eyebrows done to celebrate my 8 months!! But now I'm breaking out around my eyebrows... beauty is pain.
                  <br><br>
                  Tuesday we taught a pass-off lesson with the Spanish speaking elders in our zone. They gave us a lady named Erlinda. She is so sweet! Tuesday night, Elder Aluesi called the district chat with some bad news... President Guthrie was going to come to our District Council!! It was only bad news because we were going to play a game of scripture Jeapordy instead of have a real district council... but it all turned out alright.
                  <br><br>
                  Wednesday we had our district council with President. It went really well! President Guthrie went off for a long time about how we can help the people that we are teaching, which I predicted that he would do, and was actually really helpful. After district council we Hermanas had interviews. Mine went well! We talked about how training Hermana Oveson has been going and when I will be able to go home so I can make it in time for Fall semester to start at BYU.
                  <br><br>
                  After our interviews, President took us out to lunch at a Mexican place. It was fun! We talked to the workers in Spanish and they loved it.
                  <br><br>
                  Thursday we went out to a trailer park again and found some new friends and taught some men who were building a new porch. I also made some pumpkin chocolate chip cookies and they were heavenly. 
                  <br><br>
                  We read The Fourth Missionary for Hermana Oveson's training. The first time I read that talk it made me feel really inadequate and like I should probably just go home. But this time I read it and it made me want to be more of the fourth missionary. I used to think that I was more like the third missionary. I would do missionary things but on the inside I would be despising it and wishing that I was at home or watching TV or something. But I think I have become the fourth missionary. Being forced to rely so much on Jesus Christ, prayer, and the scriptures during my mission has allowed the Atonement of Jesus Christ to work in me and to change me. I am not the same person I was 8 months ago.
                  <br><br>
                  On Friday we taught some FIRE lessons. Literally. We got to go over and teach our friend Rachel in the backyard and we all sat around the firepit! But now all my clothes smell like camping. We got Rachel to pray and the spirit was so strong! It was amazing. 
                  <br><br>
                  Saturday we went and weeded at the Ramsey's house and that was some good work. Also that morning we were out running at the park and Hermana Cannefax tried to talk to a lady that is always there the same time that we are. Once this lady heard Hermana Cannefax say "Book of Mormon," she went off telling her about how we don't believe in the Atonement of Jesus Christ and how there were no people in America when Jesus was on the earth because the US wasn't even founded yet... But she was just trying to make sure that we were "saved" or something so her heart was probably in the right place.
                  <br><br>
                  Sunday was soooo hard. We had church and then we helped Hermana Cannefax pack all of her stuff. We stopped at Bishop's house on the way to Sugarland for a last spiritual thought and congratualations. Then we dropped off Hermana Cannefax! I was so sad. She has become one of my best friends in the 12 weeks we served together. Good thing she lives in Riverton, Utah. ðŸ˜„
                  Hermana Oveson and I will have to do our best without her!
                  <br><br>
                  Spiritual thought:
                  <br><br>
                  Alma 12:10
                  <br><br>
                  10 And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.
                  <br><br>
                  When we open our hearts to the spirit, we will be able to understand more of the mysteries of God. It is hard sometimes to humble ourselves, but it is actually the easiest thing to do. If we give up our will and do God's will, we WILL be happier in the end and we won't have to be compelled to be humber, which isn't very fun at all. Remember, remember, to keep your hearts soft and to follow the impressions of the Spirit.
                  <br><br>
                  Love y'all
                  <br><br>
                  les quiero
                  <br><br><br>
