                  Buenos dias a todos! 
                  <br><br>
                  I hope y'all had a happy and merry Christmas! We did! The Elders were able to baptize Ann and Pilar on Christmas!! It was so beautiful and so funny! In other big news, we got transfer news last night and I will be headed to Galveston today! I am very sad to be leaving Sealy and all of the people that I've met and come to love here. 5 and a half months is a long time to spend in the middle of nowhere, but it is still very hard to leave. I am excited to see the Gulf and figure out how to work another area! 
                  <br><br>
                  On Christmas Eve we had Lesson Pass Offs for Hermana Oveson. It was virtual and we called other Hermanas around the mission so Hermana Oveson could practice teaching all the lessons and get feedback. She did really well! And I was able to take note of all the Spanish grammar points we need to work on lol. 
                  <br><br>
                  When Hermana Oveson tells the Joseph Smith story she said "Jose Smith fue una arboleda" and she's trying to say that he went into the forest, but it actually means that he WAS a forest ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I made sure to correct her on that lol
                  <br><br>
                  On Christmas, we woke up and did Pres90x and then opened our presents! I got a lot of cool things! Then we had district council and we did a white elephant gift exchange. Then we had the baptism!! Elder Ketring baptized Ann, Elder Satterfield baptized Pilar. There was not enough water in the font ðŸ‘€ and Ann almost hit her head on the water spout, and either Elder Satterfield really forcefully baptized Pilar, or she just yeeted herself back really fast but it was an extreme baptism lol. They are so happy to be baptized. :)
                  <br><br>
                  We spent most of yesterday packing after we got transfer news at 2:50pm. We said goodbye to the elders a million times, but actually said goodbye this morning around 7:30am when they came to get a bike rack from us. I'm going to miss those little elders and the members here and all of the friends that we have been teaching. Hermana Oveson has a lot to take care of.

                  Mosiah 18:30 (edited)
                  <br><br>
                  30 And now it came to pass that all this was done in Sealy, yea, by the waters of Sealy, in the forest that was near the waters of Sealy; yea, the place of Sealy, the waters of Sealy, the forest of Sealy, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever.
                  <br><br>
                  Sealy is not a very beautiful place. It's just a truck stop down. The area is mostly just grass and cows. Nothing really special. But it's special to me now. Because I came to know my Redeemer here. Thank you, Sealy. I came here one way, now I am another way. All because of Jesus Christ. âœŒ
