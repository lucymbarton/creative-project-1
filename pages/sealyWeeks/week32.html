                  Buenos dias!!!
                  <br><br>
                   Another week of the mish!
                   <br><br>
                   Last P-day was boring since our elders were still in quarentine.
                   <br><br>
                   Tuesday we had to help teach/translate 2 English Connect classes! Shout out to my parents for buying us Chinese Food take-out! Yeet! We went out to our trailer park and we taught a man named Blas. He went off for like half an hour trying to say we were wrong and he just kept telling us stories from the bible and I got soooooo frustrated with him. I was like "Si lea este libro con intencion verdadera va a saber por si mismo que es la verdad!!!" And apparently he was offended last time we talked to him because I wouldn't tell him my first name... so yeah it was just a pretty useless interaction since he didn't actually have intentions to listen to us.
                   <br><br>
                   Wednesday we had District Council online and Hermana Cannefax made us fried plantains! We went out and taught three lessons in the trailer park with a recently returned missionary from our ward Elder I mean Brother Kelly. I was having a rough time since I got another ear infection :( but the Elders brought us split pea and ham soup and Blue Bell ice cream :) I think they're in love with us lol.
                   <br><br>
                   Thursday we drove out to Sugarland to see my ear doctor. He put a little sponge in my ear so that the drops actually go in. Pretty nice but the only thing is that even though my ear feels better now I can't hear because there's still a fat sponge in my ear... My Doctor said sometimes it falls out on its own but I'll go back there next Thursday for a follow up appointment and he'll take it out then. Also on Thursday we had Atonement Training over Zoom for Hermana Oveson's training.
                   <br><br>
                   Friday we finally got to have our interviews with President. He asked me about my emotional health. I was like "yeah I'm doing pretty great just wish I didn't have an ear infection lol"
                   <br><br>
                   Saturday we went and served at the Parish's house again and they have a lady who lives with them named Rachel who is not a member of our church and we invited her to attend church with the Parish's and she did!!! We finally got someone to come to church!!!!
                   <br><br>
                   So update on my goal to read the whole bible: I'm on page 404 of the Old Testament. It's finally starting to get good lol. This week I had fallen behind in my reading schedule since I slept in a few days with my ear infection so I had to catch up one day and I read 18 chapters in 1 hour. Pretty nice.
                   <br><br>
                   Spiritual thought:
                   <br><br>
                   2 Nephi 2:6
                   <br><br>
                   6 Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.
                   <br><br>
                   I testify that Jesus Christ lives. I know that He loves us and that he knows us perfectly. I testify that as we come to know Him and his sacrifice, we can recieve more peace and strength!
                   <br><br>
                   Love yall
                   <br><br><br>
