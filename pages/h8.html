                    Hola amigos y familia! 
                    <br><br>
                    I have made it safely to Texas!! I flew out of SLC on Friday afternoon and arrived in Houston around 6 pm Texas time. I spent the night at the mission home and then met my companions the next day! My compañeras son Hermana Rich Y Hermana House. Son simpáticos. Hermana Rich is our trainer and Hermana House has been in the field for about a month. She reported to the MTC on January 29th of this month. 
                    <br><br>
                    My Presidente took my phone for this first week so I can adjust easier. It's not been very difficult. We never leave our apartment except to exercise and get fresh air. I miss the MTC and walking around and socializing. I mostly miss my companion from the MTC. I wish she would have been reassigned to my mission and not the McAllen one. 
                    <br><br>
                    I will still be having my MTC classes with my same teachers and district, just over Zoom now from my apartment here. 
                    <br><br>
                    We have had a few lecciones en llamada video en nuestra apartamento. I have been able to share my testimony and a little bit about Joseph Smith. It is especially hard to understand Spanish over the phone. 
                    <br><br>
                    Im not sure where exactly I am but we are in the Richmond Zone. Somewhere in Houston. 
                    <br><br>
                    I miss you all and love you all. Plz send emails and memes and pictures of life in Utah. 
                    <br><br><br>
                    Hermana Barton
                    <br><br>
                    Ps. There is so much animal life here! I've already seen like 30 squirrels and some lizards and caterpillars and butterflies and also a roach and spider and mosquito. oh and we heard gunshots from our apartment last night. Apparently that happens pretty often when you dont live a sheltered life in Utah.

                    Buenos días amigos y familia!!
                    <br><br>
                    I'm still here in Texas! Still stuck inside all day! Bored out of my mind sometimes but we also teach lessons on video call and try to find people on Facebook and connect more with members. 
                    <br><br>
                    How about General Conference?? It really was unforgettable. I am so happy that we have a modern day prophet and continual revelation. 
                    <br><br>
                    As for the subject line, I never know whether to say my last name in an English or a Spanish accent when we have our lessons. A lady we are teaching asked for my name and I said "Me llamo Hermana Barton" and then she said "Hermana Virgin?" And I was like "yeah" lol. 
                    <br><br>
                    Every morning we wake up and go do exercise in a parking lot across the street. We call it our "gym" I mostly just run a few laps and then do stretches and crunches and jumping jacks. 
                    <br><br>
                    My companions and I are getting to know each other more every day and it's getting funnier to be around them. We went to the Chickfila drive through and got ice cream cones this week! And today I got a burger from Burger King. the first burger I've had in 27 days. 
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking of 27 days, I did the math and I'm already 5% done with my mission! I will only have to do what I just did 19 more times. lol
                    <br><br>
                    The work still presses on. No unhallowed hand can stop the work of the Lord. 
                    <br><br>
                    I miss music and movies and Netflix and this week I've had cravings of going to Disneyland or Lagoon or a Museum or an Aquarium or something. And today we were required to wear masks when we went shopping. I am ready for this covid-19 to be over. 
                    <br><br>
                    My companions are really sweet and they are great cooks! We have been making lots of salads and eating fruits (especially apples with peanut butter). Hermana Rich says she feels great being able to choose what she eats now that members do not feed her every day. 
                    <br><br>
                    I hope everything is going well at home! I miss you all and love you dearly! If you didn't have a chance to listen to conference, I'd highly recommend it!  So many message of hope and peace. And isn't our dear Prophet just so cute? 
                    <br><br>
                    Love
                    <br><br><br>

                    Hola familia y amigos! 
                    <br><br>
                    Yes I'm still here in Houston! Even some of the members in our ward think that we all got sent home. Sometimes I wish that were true lol but I'd be stuck inside doing nothing if I were at home too. 
                    <br><br>
                    This week was pretty eventful! We had a devotional by Andy Reid (some football dude, maybe someone knows him)
                    We also had a devotional from Brad Wilcox!!!! I love Brad Wilcox. I took Doctrines and Teachings of the Book of Mormon from him in the Fall semester and it was the only lecture I actually looked forward to attending. We have all our devotionals over Zoom and President Guthrie asked for people to send in videos of them singing a verse of a hymn to play as the musical number in devotionals. My companions and I sent in us singing "Mas Cerca Dios De Ti" and president played it for the Brad Wilcox devotional! And Brother Wilcox used it in his talk. He said that that was the song that they sang on the Titanic, the "unsinkable ship" and he talked about how the world is sinking right now but we're on the life boats. (Hence the subject line) 
                    <br><br>
                    We also had interviews with President this week. We had them on Friday, the day of the worldwide fast. We started our fast on Wednesday after lunch so we could eat lunch on Friday. We drove to the mission home and Sister Guthrie made us lettuce wraps and quesadillas while we took turns for interviews. The lettuce wraps were most specifically for Hermana Rich because she's trying to do Keto. I am not. I believe carbs are a necessary nutrient somehow lol. 
                    My interview with President went well. Hermana Rich told us the night before that we could ask him for a priesthood blessing so I did.
                    <br><br>
                    The hardest things for me right now are being stuck inside and not knowing when I'll leave and missing my boyfriend. I don't even miss my mom and dad (sorry mom)  since I get to call them 2 times a week while we're in isolation. 
                    <br><br>
                    Yesterday was Easter!! Happy Easter! We taught a ton of lessons yesterday about Easter, specifically the resurrection,  on video calls. Someone sent Hermana Rich a plate of dried fruit but no one knows who it was... Today we're going to buy discount Easter candy at Walmart. 😁
                    <br><br>
                    This week is the last week of the transfer! And as of last Friday I've been on the mission for a month! To me it feels like way longer than that. It's hard to think about how much longer I have! 
                    <br><br>
                    How's everyone? What do you do all day? 
                    <br><br>
