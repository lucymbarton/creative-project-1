                    Buenas d√≠as amigos y familia!
                    <br><br>
                    This week has been rough, not gonna lie. I've been frustrated and bored and wishing I was home. I told my president that I was thinking about going home but all the temples are closed so I guess I'll stay here lol.
                    <br><br>
                    Biggest news is that I transferred last night! I am now in the Friendswood zone and the Manvel Area. My new companion is Hermana Crookston. She seems really nice! She is from Virginia and goes to school at BYU. She has a boyfriend that she already has a date to marry. She only has 3 or 4 transfers left.
                    <br><br>
                    We still are staying inside the apartment all day. There are no signs of anything changing anytime soon. The peak of COVID should be this week in Houston.
                    <br><br>
                    My companions and I went on a couple bike rides on trails by the bayou and it was really pretty. I really appreciated the chance to be outside in nature and the air felt so fresh!
                    <br><br>
                    It was sad to leave Hermana Rich and Hermana house and the cute people we were teaching. I will especially miss sweet Yancy and sweet Maria. I hope that I will make it back to H8 someday so I can actually meet them in person. On my last day in the area we finally had a lesson with the family that we have a few of them on date to be baptized! Cute family. Hopefully they go through with their baptisms and can be baptized soon. And I had to pack up everything again. Hermana Crookston is my 5th companion and it's only my 41st day on the mission!
                    <br><br>
                    The weather here has been really nice this week. There was a tornado warning yesterday but that didn't happen. The rain and thunderstorms are really cool here.
                    <br><br>
                    How are you all? How are your families? What's the big news? Miss you and love you all.
                    <br><br>

                    Hola familia y amigos! 
                    <br><br>
                    This week went a lot better than last week! I have had like a million times more motivation to actually be a missionary lol. 
                    <br><br>
                    Let's get into it!
                    <br><br>
                    So my new apartment is actually in Manvel, Texas. (despite what my parents keep telling you, I'm not IN Friendswood, I'm actually about 30 minutes away from Friendswood, although it is in my area. we have a very big area right now) We have taken over an area from the Elders in addition to our original area, so we are now over two areas! The Elders had to leave because we just don't have enough missionaries to have two companionships in a ward. We lost about 30 missionaries last month with all the Corona changes and then this transfer we also opened up a new stake with 10 wards that we got from the Texas Houston mission. So we really are quite short on missionaries right now. We are hoping to get more missionaries next transfer which is in June.
                    <br><br>
                    So funny story... We were supposed to get the elder's SIM card when we took over their area. And President said he gave Hermana Crookston a post it note with the SIM card taped on it, but we don't really remember a post it note. All we have is an envelope that says "Manvel North Sims Card" so obviously we assumed the SIM card was in there. It wasn't... so we called the APs and they said that it wasn't a big deal. But then we got a message from President. "CALL ME ASAP!" So we called him. President asked Hermana Crookston to think back on when they were talking in the parking lot of the mission office and he gave her the SIM card on the post it note. Hermana Crookstone couldn't remember the post it note, just the envelope. President said "I didn't give you the envelope. I told Sister Guthrie yesterday that Elder Button had so many envelopes in the office that I decided I was not going to touch any of them so I didn't mess anything up. So forget about the envelope!" But we couldn't forget about the envelope because it was the only thing we had. President told us to pray and look for the post it note. And we did. And we never found the SIM card. And we never forgot about the envelope. Sorry President.
                    <br><br>
                    I love my new apartment complex! There's this little pond in the middle of it full of turtles and ducks and fish and apparently snakes. There is this cute family of Herons that come here to fish as well. Every time we go outside we get to walk around the pond and watch the turtles and try to see the snakes. They are cute little turtles.
                    <br><br>
                    Oh and I got my first Texas ant bite! I wasn't paying attention to where I was stepping and I stepped on an ant hill. But I only got one bite, which is good. For those who don't know, you can't just frolic in the grass here like you can in Utah. There are ant hills literally everywhere and they will eat you alive. :)
                    <br><br>
                    My companion Hermana Crookston is really fun! She has a boyfriend, Austin, at home who she is going to marry this December. It has been really nice to talk to her about Jacob since she really understands a lot of how I feel. She is hard working and we have been teaching 3 or 4 lessons every day. We teach a lot of member lessons and that keeps us busy. Those of you at home should see if the missionaries in your area want to teach you a lesson! Because I'm sure they are probably bored out of their minds lol. In my last area pretty much all of our lessons were in Spanish, but here there are a lot more "Spanish speaking people" who actually prefer English. So we've been teaching a lot of lessons in English. Which is weird. And I don't have an excuse for not knowing what to say lol. 
                    <br><br>
                    Since we don't have many missionaries, there is only one district in our zone. Which makes our district our zone and our zone our district. But we still have a District Leader and Zone Leaders. They have developed a rivalry.
                    <br><br>
                    Our Zone is having a family history competition where we get points by attatching sources and memories and creating new people. I have moved on to the 2nd round!! 
                    <br><br>
                    Oh and on Friday we had a devotional from David Archuleta! President Guthrie has a lot of connections and we love hearing from all his famous friends! :)
                    <br><br>
                    And have I told you all about Pres90X? Every morning at 6:30, President does a Zoom call where he leads us in some exercise. Most of the time it's a lot of squats and lunges and pushups, but it really goes hard! I've been losing weight here on my mission! (something most Texan missionaries cannot say)
                    <br><br>
                    Here's my spiritual thought!!
                    In my personal study, I came across this verse in Mosiah 7.
                    23 And now, is not this grievous to be borne? And is not this, our affliction, great? Now behold, how great reason we have to mourn.
                    I can relate to this verse very much! My mom knows that I love to feel sorry for myself, so when I read this verse I was like "haha that's me" and I'm sure a lot of you can also relate to this. With all the Corona and people being sick and dying and having to be stuck inside and not seeing our friends and family, is this not grievous to be borne? And how great reason we have to mourn! Right?
                    The answer to these questions is found in verse 33!
                    33 But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.
                    Soooo if we turn to the Lord with all our hearts, trust Him, and serve Him, He will DELIVER US out of bondage! (according to his own will and pleasure(which we should trust in also))
                    I loved this verse so much that I wrote it on sticky note and put it on my wall. Because even though it seems like everything in life gives me great reason to mourn, I know that I can trust in God's plan for me and for the world. And I know that the best place for me and for you all is as close to God as we can be. That is where peace is found. :)
                    <br><br>
                    Thanks to everyone who sent kind messages and packages and letters! I have more candy now than I know what do do with.
                    <br><br>
                    Love you all and miss you so much!
                    <br><br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    This week was fair. It has been a difficult week for my family as my aunt Laura passed away this week from cancer. Please keep them in your prayers.
                    <br><br>
                    We heard from our president last night that although Texas has been opening up restaurants, theaters, and businesses to 25% capacity, nothing of our situation will change. We will still be in the apartments and only leaving for necessary trips. That was pretty much what I expected to happen. I think we are still pretty far away from being able to actually go out into the world and proselyte. 
                    <br><br>
                    A big bummer this week is that the lady we had on date to be baptized dropped us! Her name is Gloria and she was supposed to be baptized on the 16th of May but she told us she needs to figure out her life first before she commits to being baptized. We hope that she actually does come back to meet with us soon. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our most progressing Friend is Lesly! She is 19 (I believe) and she loves God and loves reading the Book of Mormon. At the end of every call that we have with her she asks when we can meet again. What's kinda awkward is she's told us about how much she likes her other church and I'm like "... you know who we are and what we do... right?" But she really likes to meet with us so we'll see how that goes.
                    <br><br>
                    BIG NEWS! WE SAW THE SNAKE!!
                    So on like Tuesday or Wednesday this week we went outside to walk around the pond in our complex and there was this lady walking towards us and she looked like she wanted to talk to us. Hermana Crookston got really excited at that lol. The lady said she just almost stepped on a snake and she turned back this way to go tell the apartment complex managers. She definitely told us to warn us so we didn't run into the snake, but we walked past her and tried to get a look at the snake. And we saw it!! He/she was a pretty long boi/goirl and it slithered down the grass and into the pond and we guess he lives in a hole on the side of the pond. Sadly this was the one time I left my phone in the apartment so no pictures. :(
                    <br><br>
                    If any of you are wondering how my schedule usually is, I'll tell you. We wake up at 6:30, exercise until 7, take turns showering and eating breakfast until 8, then we plan for the day. After planning we have personal study for an hour and then we usually go outside and walk around the pond. The rest of the day depends on when we have lessons scheduled, but we usually have 3 lessons and then we have to do 1 hour of Spanish study and 1 hour of Companion study. We have lunch from 12-1 and dinner from 5-6. Then at 9 we get ready for bed and lights are off at 10:30!
                    <br><br>
                    Also on Friday we had a goal to find or die! (hence the subject line) AKA we weren't going to watch the movie for movie night until we found someone. So we were calling all our formers on ABP and at 8:05 we set a lesson with someone who had already been taught! That counts as a find!! And the movie started at 8:15!! The movie we started this week was The Fighting Preacher. It was SOO good and I'm really excited to finish it this Friday.
                    <br><br>
                    If you made it to this point in my email send a reply and let me know how your weekend was!!
                    <br><br>
                    Les quiero mucho!

                    How are you all? I am still here, in Texas, sitting on the same plastic chair and at the same plastic table! Smelling the same weed! Loving the missionary life right now. üôÉ 
                    <br><br>
                    Many parts of our apartment are actually broken at the moment. Some of our doorknobs are falling off, our toilet seat is broken, the sink leaks, the lightbulbs are burning out, the dryer takes 3 cycles to actually dry our clothes, the light in the refrigerator is out, our blinds are broken, and it very frequently reeks of weed! We sent in a maintenance request but we haven't heard anything back. So we're still living here just dealing with it all. At least the air conditioning works and so does our oven and mircrowave!
                    <br><br>
                    We had a really cool devotional this last Tuesday by a man namd David Butler. I believe he teaches at BYU? I'd never heard of him before. He shared a really cool message. He told us to imagine the scene where the Israelites were escaping Egypt and they came up on the Red Sea with the strongest army in the world at the time coming up behind them. He asked "What would be the title of this picture? Probably 'Big Mistake' or 'Distaster' well I'd call it 'Edge of a Miracle'" (hence the subject line) He said that miracles never come when everything goes exactly how we expect it to go. So when everything seems like a disaster and you feel like a complete mess, remember that you're on the edge of a miracle! I loved that. 
                    <br><br>
                    I was very blessed this week to be able to watch the online stream of my aunt Laura's funeral. It was very sad not to be able to be there in person, but I was able to go to a church building (for the first time since I've been here apart from the mission office) and use a computer there to watch the stream. The service was very sweet and I send lots of love to my family. ‚ù§‚ù§
                    <br><br>
                    Today marks 2 months since I entered the MTC. 2 months sounds like a long time and it feels like I've been here foooreeevveerrrrrrrr. But I still have 15ish months left until I'll come home. And at this point it looks like I'll be stuck inside for the majority of my mission. I just might go psycho.
                    <br><br>
                    On Saturday, Hermana Crookston had 100 days left on her mission so we went to Chickfila and made Keto baby cheesecakes. They are pretty good for not having any sugar in them. 
                    <br><br>
                    We have finally been able to contact a few of the people that the Elders were teaching in their area that we took over. Oh and there's news on the SIM card! We got 3 new sisters in this week who were serving in Korea and got reassigned to our mission. While the sisters were at the mission office, one of them saw something shiny on the ground in the parking lot! It was a SIM card!! We are not for sure that it is our SIM card because President hasn't tested it out yet but we are pretty sure. Hopefully it didn't get ruined by sitting in the parking lot for 3 weeks...
                    <br><br>
                    Still having some rough times this week, wondering why God called me here at this time and in this place and trying my best to focus on my missionary purpose. It's really hard to be here when I'm not really sure why I wanted to serve a mission and why I want to stay. Hopefully I will figure it out.
                    <br><br>
                    How are you all??  Please email me I'm lonely!!! There's nothing fun to do here except read emails during the week and I literally only got 1! I am so bored.

                    Buenos d√≠as familia y amigos!!
                    <br><br>
                    This week was full of miracles! 
                    <br><br>
                    On Tuesday we had Zone conference over Zoom. It was pretty good! We talked about having faith in Christ during this time.
                    <br><br>
                    We also were able to serve one of the members of our ward by (trying) to read with her 6 year old. At first we tried reading the Libro de Mormon with her, but that was too hard so we tried reading from the folletos! It was really cute because she would sound out every single letter lol. And somehow this 6 year old spoke Spanish better than I do and I was like "hang on that's not even fair."
                    <br><br>
                    On Wednesday the best thing happened!! The maintenance people from our apartment complex came!! They fixed our toilet seat!! And put new lightbulbs in! And fixed our door knobs! So now it's like we're living in a new apartment. And we don't have to worry about falling in the toilet anymore lol. 
                    <br><br>
                    On Thursday the maintenance people came again and installed some new blinds and gave us a new kitchen faucet (!!). The awkward thing was that we were in the middle of teaching a lesson so we had to go sit in our car and teach. I had my phone up on the dashboard with our Facebook Messenger video chat going and my phone overheated!! It shut down all my apps and ended the call. I had to hold my phone in front of the air conditioning vent so that I could turn on the hot spot so Hermana Crookston could call on her phone. Very eventful lesson lol. And my phone is fine, just probably melted a little bit inside lol.
                    <br><br>
                    So now our apartment is all fixed and there's light in our fridge and above our table and everything! We really got a new quality of life this week. (hence the subject line)
                    <br><br>
                    On Thursday night we got two referrals!! So on Friday we got permission to go over to their house and drop off some Libros de Mormon!!! My first visit to people in real life and my first two Book of Mormons handed out.  It was pretty exciting. On Friday we also had a lesson with Maria and we had invited her to read the Book of Mormon every day and pray to know that it was true and she said that if she knew it was true that she would be baptized! And she said she wants to be baptized!! We are very excited for her. She has been taught by the missionaries for 6 years! Her son just put in his mission papers and we are just very excited. No date set yet but we hope to get that this week. 
                    <br><br>
                    There was also a big thunder storm on Friday and that was pretty exciting. The pond in our complex was pretty full and we saw the snake again!! I got videos this time. 
                    <br><br>
                    We went on a couple bike rides in the neighborhood by our complex this week and it's a cute little neighborhood. Pics to come. 
                    <br><br>
                    On Sunday Obispo brought us the Sacrament! It has been hard for us to get the sacrament since members aren't technically supposed to come into our apartment according to our stake president but our bishop got special permission. Also I prayed on Saturday night that someone would bring us some food and some members (the pe√±as) brought us WhataBurger for lunch! (On Sunday... yeah but it was good)
                    <br><br>
                    So that's my week! Here's my spiritual thought. In Come Follow Me this week we are still studying in Mosiah. I love the example of the people of Alma in Mosiah 24:14-16. 
                    <br><br>

                    14 And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.
                        15 And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.
                        16 And it came to pass that so great was their faith and their patience that the voice of the Lord came unto them again, saying: Be of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage.
                        <br><br>
                    I love how it says that the people submitted cheerfully and with patience to the will of the Lord. I have had to work on this. I prayed for patience last week for the first time in my life. I've never done it before because people always say that when they pray for patience they get stuck in a traffic jam or something lol. But I've really had to develop patience and cheerfulness while I submit myself to the will of the Lord. I have faith in the will of God (el voluntad de Dios).
                    <br><br>
                    Also I've been reading the Book of Mormon a lot this week because I've been given the "Atonement Challenge" where we have to circle where Christ is mentioned, underline the Atonement, and highlight the Doctrine of Christ. It has been really exciting. I read through all of Alma and I'm already in Helaman 11. The Book of Mormon gets a lot more exciting when you read it faster, I've found. And I know that it has SO much POWER!!
                    <br><br>
                    Oh and we started teaching the other sisters in our zone Spanish this week and that was fun!
                    <br><br>
                    That's my week! If you got this far please send me your favorite recipe that takes less than 30 minutes to make! I'm running out of ideas for food to eat lol. Or send me your favorite crockpot recipe! I'm so excited to hear from you all!!
                    <br><br>
                    Love y'all

                    Hola familia y amigos!
                    <br><br>
                    Another week in the mission!
                    <br><br>
                    Last Monday we were able to go to a park with the other missionaries in our District and we ate Raising Cane's and threw a frisbee around. It was quite fun! Although I did get a spider bite... (hence the subject line) The spider bite has been one of the most exciting aspects of our week. My left ankle was swollen like a balloon and terribly itchy. I talked to our mission nurse and she told me to ice it, but on cortisone cream, raise my leg while sitting, and take Benadryl at night and my spider bite has gotten a lot better!
                    <br><br>
                    On Tuesday we had a devotional from Elder Mckay who is in our Area presidency. His talk was really good! We read in Doctrine and Covenants 59:21 about how the wrath of God is kindled against those who don't confess his hand in all things.
                    <br><br>
                    Elder Mckay explained that God does not CAUSE all things (though he may allow things to happen) but his hand is IN all things. He said "No matter where we are or how we got there, God's hand is always there to steady us, strengthen us, and ultimately deliver us." And we just need to REACH for his hand!
                    <br><br>
                    On Friday we had a devotional from the Prophet's daughter. She and her husband talked about President Nelson from their perspective. Sadly, we were only able to watch about half an hour of it because we had a lesson with a former named Gary. We did end up finding Gary so the lesson was not a complete bust. In fact, we found 3 people in one day on Friday! Gary, Benjamin, and Ivory! They all seem to be quite interested in our message. Benjamin was a special find because we actually called what we thought was someone else's number and Benjamin picked up and when we told him we were missionaries he was actually interested in hearing what we had to say! And he speaks Spanish so that's doubly special!
                    <br><br>
                    Also on Friday, for movie night, we watched "Out of Liberty". It was quite a crazy movie. There were a lot of events in that movie that I didn't even know happened! 
                    <br><br>
                    Hermana Crookston and I also had our interview with President this week. They were through Facebook Messenger. President asked me if I'd be interested in being the Social Media Specialist for the mission! I said yes! He said there are still some things that need to be worked out and I'll have to be trained but I'm excited to work in that calling. The Social Media Specialist is over all of the Facebook Pages in the mission and conducts training, research, and handles the advertisements for Facebook pages for the mission. My area doesn't have a Facebook page yet... But we did get a new video editing application this week and that has been fun to play around with!
                    <br><br>
                    On Sunday, Hermana Crookston and I studied the Come, Follow Me chapter for the week. I thought it was REALLY good. I honestly am in love with the Book of Mormon and Alma is literally the coolest. Both the old one and the young one. We watched the Book of Mormon video for when Alma the Younger gets smitten by the angel and it was awesome. I'd invite you all to watch it! It's about 11 minutes long.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    I am almost done with the Book of Mormon again! I started reading in 1 Nephi when I was on the plane to Houston and now I am in Moroni 9! I honestly love the Book of Mormon and it is so interesting and has so much power!! And it truly is the keystone of our religion. If the Book of Mormon was not true, we wouldn't have a religion. Good thing it for sure is true!!
                    <br><br>
                    One last scripture I'd like to share. 1 John 4:7-9
                    <br><br>
                    7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
                    <br><br>
                    8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
                    <br><br>
                    9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him
                    <br><br>
                    Truly we have this life and our savior and the Book of Mormon and a living prophet because GOD LOVES US! I am continually amazed by his love. 
                    <br><br>
                    Love you all, looking forward to hearing how you've been :)

                    Hola familia y amigos!!!
                    <br><br>
                     Happy Monday! And Happy June! Today I have finished 2 transfers of my mission! And I finished my "first" transfer in the field! We are going to have a very crazy summer here in the THSM. We expect to get 200 missionaries by the end of August! And we will receive 64 missionaries in June. In fact, Hermana Crookston and I will be driving to the mission office tonight to pick up our new companion! We will be a trio this transfer.
                     <br><br>
                     On Tuesday this week, we went down to a park in Friendswood to film a video about the new Restoration Proclamation with our Zone. It was really weird to meet our Zone leaders in real life... Elder Borden is like 6'5" and he is a real giant. Also I got 6 mosquito bites from the park! Bugs like to eat me I guess.
                     <br><br>
                     On Tuesday we also got take out from Buffalo Wild Wings (B Dubs) and that was exciting! And we went to deliver a libro de mormon to an old referral that actually never got his book and he wasn't home so we gave his libro to a man named Julio who may or may not be his husband?? And then he never answered our calls so that was awkward.
                     <br><br>
                     There have been a few thunderstorms this week! Once lightning struck right outside our window! It was so loud! And exciting.
                     <br><br>
                     On Thursday we had a devotional with Jarom and Spencer from the Safety Zone (a funny show about missionary safety) and one of the directors from the Book of Mormon Videos! It was really cool.
                     <br><br>
                     On Friday, we had our first "Institute" class with David Butler! It was so amazing! We read from John 1 and talked about the Good News of the Gospel and how we're all saved by the grace of Jesus Christ! We talked about how in the vision of the tree of life there are two groups of people who hold onto the rod and make it to the tree, but the second group, after continually holding fast to the rod, make it to the tree and FALL DOWN! We learn that the tree represents Jesus Christ, so we can see that these people have known Christ more than the other group who made it to the tree and ended up leaving.
                     In John 1, we read that when John the Baptist sees Jesus, he says, "Behold the Lamb of God!" and we can see that John also knew Christ as he could tell just by seeing him that he was the Son of God! We should ask ourselves "Where am I in my relationship with Christ? If I saw him, would I fall down? Would I be able to recognize him and say "this is the Lamb of God!"?
                     <br><br>
                     For movie night we watched the first half of 17 miracles.
                     <br><br>
                     On Sunday we got the Sacrament from la familia Pe√±a and they brought us food! It was really good food. And it was great to get the sacrament! It was awkward because they really weren't supposed to stay for very long but they stayed for a long time. We sang 3 hymns all the way through and they shared their testimonies and everything. It was awkward because they wouldn't look at me because I guess they thought I couldn't understand anything but I really understood like 95% of it so it was just kinda rude of them to not look at me. :\ We disinfected everything after they left.
                     <br><br>
                     So that's my week!
                     <br><br>
                     Here's some scriptures I liked this week:
                     <br><br>
                     1 Nephi 16:1-2
                      1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speaking to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear.
                     2 And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I had spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center.
                     <br><br>
                     2 Nephi 10:23
                     23 Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves‚Äîto choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.
                     <br><br>
                     2 Nephi 26:13, 33
                     13 And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among the children of men according to their faith.
                     33 For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.
                     <br><br>
                     2 Nephi 33:6
                     6 I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.
                     <br><br>
                     I know that Christ lives! I know that we have been saved through Him! And that is the Good News of the Gospel! I know that he loves all of us individually and that there is a great plan laid out for each of us!
                     <br><br>
                     Love you all!
                     <br><br><br>
                     Hermana Barton
                     <br><br>
                     PS. So we heard this week that we will be allowed to go and do service like helping with yard work and stuff! Any maybe we'll be able to meet in the church buildings with our district for district council! Exciting stuff!

                <p>
                    Good morning my people! 
                    <br><br>
                    This week has been kinda crazy.
                    <br><br>
                    So to start out, We have a new companion! Her name is Hermana Eliason and she is from California. She served 8 months in Argentina and was reassigned to our mission. It has been interesting to have her here since in Argentina she had such a different mission experience. Like she would only speak in Spanish and they didn't have smart phones! So it's been a lot of showing her how to use the Area Book Planer app and Facebook and everything. 
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking of Facebook, my area got a Facebook page! It's something like Followers of Jesus Christ in Friendswood and Pearland Texas. Y'all can like it if you want to. I'll also be sharing some of our posts to my personal page. Oh and I found out at transfers on Monday that I didn't actually get called as the Social Media Specialist so that's awkward. But I might be getting called as the Social Media Specialist's assistant soon. But still pretty awkward. RIP.
                    <br><br>
                    President asked Hermana Crookston and I to help put together a video welcoming all the new missionaries and on Monday we got a bunch of clips from other missionaries and stitched them together and showed it at Transfers and President didn't like it I guess. So on Tuesday I clipped the videos and put them together differently and put music behind them and the APs and President liked it a lot better. Maybe President will bring us In n Out Burger now!
                    <br><br>
                    So on Tuesday night we really thought we were going to die! Well, my companions did. I was pretty much dead asleep and I heard pounding on our front door and then I heard Hermana Crookston say "Is someone knocking?" and then I heard her go and open the front door and there were people out there so then I got out of bed to go see what was happening.
                    So apparently some Hermanas who had just come from the mission office had forgotten to grab the keys to their apartment (they live in our same complex) and had been pounding on our door since 10:30. Hermana Eliason and Hermana Crookston thought that the raids had made it here to Manvel (kinda funny because it's just a tiny little down full of trailer parks) and they locked themselves in the bathroom and were crying and praying. And they just left me there asleep in my bed to die! Lol. Then Hermana Crookston was like "I need to check my phone!" and she had like 20 missed calls. So we had to drive over to the church at like 11:30pm so the Hermanas could park their car there since they didn't have a permit yet and then they slept on our floor that night. It was pretty crazy. 
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking of the raids, the George Floyd funeral is going to be happening tomorrow in Pearland. Literally 10 minutes away from my apartment! So we are not allowed to leave our apartment today or tomorrow in case some crazy stuff goes down. We got permission to go shopping on Saturday, so we will be fine with food!
                    <br><br>
                    My parents Door Dashed us some really yummy Mexican food this week and Hermana Crookston said it was the best food she'd had on her entire mission!
                    <br><br>
                    Hermana Eliason likes to listen to the Saints book during meals and then she goes and lays in her bed and listens and twice this week she has just fallen asleep and Hermana Crookston and I didn't know what to do to wake her up! It was quite hilarious. We have this little silver bell that someone left here and we were ringing it and ringing it but Hermana Eliason had Beats headphones on and couldn't hear it!
                    <br><br>
                    We had the great opportunity to hear from Elder Soares of the Quorum of the 12 Apostles this week! He is such a cute man! He talked about how if we have faith we can make it through all of the "pandemics" of our lives. 
                    <br><br>
                    Institute with David Butler this week was amazing. He talked about how the one word that describes God's purpose is "Become" and the word that describes how he achieves his purpose is "Jesus" and the word for how we can achieve Eternal life is "Gospel". Then he talked about how the creation story is actually poetic and not how it actually went down. It was really awesome.
                    <br><br>
                    On Friday we had our first district council in person! It was weird. On Friday also we had another lesson with Maria and tried to get her on date again and she said no... So that was awkward too.
                    <br><br>
                    Our friend Lesly is still progressing quite well, but she said one of the churches she goes to opened!! And she still doesn't quite understand that if the Book of Mormon is true ( and she loves reading it) that all of the other churches don't have the fullness of the gospel! But I guess since our church isn't open yet it can't necessarily hurt for her to go to a different one on Sunday.
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual thought:
                    <br><br>
                    Mosiah 4: 9-10
                    <br><br>
                    9 Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.
                    <br><br>
                    10 And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.
                    <br><br>
                    I love these scriptures! Truly it is a comfort to my soul to know that we have a loving Heavenly Father who created this world for us. And I know that man cannot understand everything that God can. Of course sometimes it is hard to wonder WHY! Why do I have these trials? Why is there COVID-19? Why do we need to be baptized? Why do we need to repent? But We can trust in God. He comprehendeth all things and He loves us and wants what is best for us.
                    <br><br>
                    I also love the very end of verse 10. "And now, if ye believe all these things SEE THAT YE DO THEM." It can be pretty easy to simply believe in God and believe that Jesus Christ lived and died for us so that we can be forgiven, but it is harder to ACT on that faith. But I know with all my heart that when we do the little things like praying, reading the scriptures, and repenting every day, we will be able to feel the spirit more strongly and receive that power from God to help us in our every day lives. 
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    This week went by really fast! My companions are so funny! Hermana Eliason is lactose intolerant but she just keeps eating stuff with milk in it and Hermana Crookston and I are like "you're going to die!!" And she says "yeah but it'll be worth it!" And then she gets sick and spends a lot of time in the bathroom!
                    <br><br>
                    We did a lot of service this week for a lady in the English ward who has a beauty salon but decided to stop renting her space and then she had a lot of stuff at her place and we went over and helped her organize all of that too. It was a really nice break from our apartment. 
                    <br><br>
                    On Sunday we had really run out of food but we got fed a ton by two members and we got the sacrament! It was awesome. 
                    <br><br>
                    This week we will be trying to get our friend Lesly on date to be baptized! We are going to be meeting with her in person at the church for the first time! We can meet in the church with masks and lots of hand sanitizer! 
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing else really this week. I've been going through some heart break! But I love this quote from Elder Holland. 
                    <br><br>
                    "Because the Restoration reaffirmed the foundational truth that God does work in this world, we can hope, we should hope, even when facing the most insurmountable odds...
                        So, I ask, ‚ÄúIf so many of our 1820 hopes could begin to be fulfilled with a flash of divine light to a mere boy kneeling in a patch of trees in upstate New York, why should we not hope that righteous desires and Christlike yearnings can still be marvelously, miraculously answered by the God of all hope?‚Äù We all need to believe that what we desire in righteousness can someday, someway, somehow yet be ours....
                    Truly when hope is gone, what we have left is the flame of the inferno raging on every side.
                        So, when our backs are to the wall and, as the hymn says, ‚Äúother helpers fail and comforts flee,‚Äù among our most indispensable virtues will be this precious gift of hope linked inextricably to our faith in God and our charity to others."
                        <br><br>
                    Love you all! Hope you have a good week!
                    <br><br><br>

                    Buenas d√≠as familia y amigos!!
                    <br><br>
                    Esta semana went by really fast!!
                    <br><br>
                    On Tuesday we got to meet with our friend Lesly in person and WE SET HER ON DATE TO BE BAPTIZED!! July 12th!! We are so excited for Lesly to be baptized! She is excited and wants her whole family to come because she wants to be a good example to them. Lesly is awesome! 
                    <br><br>
                    On Wednesday I got to have a Spanish tutoring call with Hermano Astorga!! It was great!! 
                    <br><br>
                    But the same day my ear started hurting!! And even though I was putting heat on it, it got worse the next day! So I called our mission nurse and she gave me permission to use the Connect Care App to see a doctor and I got prescribed some antibiotics. But after 24 hours my ear still hurt A LOT and I also couldn't hear! (Hence the subject line. "Como?" Is what you say if you want someone to repeat what they said!) So on Friday we went to the emergency room! It was a pretty pleasant experience actually. They looked at my ear and said I should be using drops along with the antibiotics. and they prescribed me some pain pills! And today my ear is feeling a lot better!
                    <br><br>
                    The pain pills make me drowsy and I had to lay down to let my ear drain, so I spent a lot of time this week in bed. It was actually quite nice. But I'm excited to go head first back into missionary work this week!! We saw a lot of miracles this week with receiving a referral and contacting formers that sound really interested! And we saw a rainbow last night!! 
                    <br><br>
                    Oh and Thursday was my 100th day as a missionary! So to celebrate we went to Buffalo Wild Wings and got BOGO boneless wings! 
                    <br><br>
                    And last Monday we went to Bucees! It's a famous giant gas station/ souvenir shop! It was really fun. 
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual thought:
                    <br><br>
                    Alma 26:35-36
                    35 Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.
                    36 Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us, wanderers in a strange land.

                    I think Ammon really says it all! God is Good!!

                    Buenos dias!!! 
                    <br><br>
                    How are you all? Happy Monday!!
                    <br><br>
                    This week we had Zone Conference! It was over Zoom and we just had the entire mission on it. We talked about our "why" of coming on the mission and of staying here. I've always never been able to figure out my "why" except it just felt right. But I decided that I came on my mission because Satan didn't want me to and I'm still here because now I just have no reason to go home! I'm sure if I was at home I'd be bored and depressed out of my mind! But out here I am doing great!!
                    <br><br>
                    Sister Guthrie shared a story about a little girl who bought a fake pearl necklace and loved it and then her father asked her to give it to him and she didn't want to. But eventually she did and he gave her a great big necklace with real pearls on it! So I decided to give up some of the problems I've been facing from at home. It's been pretty awesome. I don't even have to think about it anymore!! 
                    <br><br>
                    Hermana Crookston's mom sent a package and it had Squishmallows in it for me and Hermana Eliason!! Mine is a little kitty named Tabitha and she is so squishy. 
                    <br><br>
                    We had our interviews with President this week and mine went really well. I roasted a whole bunch of people and President said that I'm a perfect example of someone who has come to the mission and adjusted and just keeps improving every week and has that light of Christ! He said "Never lose that, Hermana!" and I said "I won't!"
                    <br><br>
                    In other big news, I am now the Facebook page admin for the Spanish page over Brazoria and Galveston Counties. It has been created and I have to figure out how I want to organize my missionaries to create posts so I can post them and we can hopefully find some people to teach on Facebook some day. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our most progressing investigators are still Lesly and Ivory! I love both of them!! Lesly is hopefully going to be baptized on July 12. She has injured her knee and is scared it will interfere with her baptism! We all need to pray for Lesly's knee. 
                    <br><br>
                    Ivory is just the sweetest man I've ever taught and we call him on the phone and he loves hearing from us! His entire family attends another church, but he says "People don't understand you Mormons. There's something really special about y'all ministering sisters. That's why we're still communicating."
                    We asked him to be baptized and he said he wants to! He talked to his mom (he's like 50 and still talks to his mom about stuff aw) and his mom said he should pray about it! So we told him that too! But we know for sure that he'll get that positive witness for himself of the truthfulness of our message. 
                    The only problem is that Ivory doesn't speak any Spanish!! So we're going to have to hand him over to the english sisters at some point. :( But we love him!!! 
                    <br><br>
                    That's about all from my week. We found a cockroach in our bathroom!! Oh and the gym in our complex is closed again since COVID cases have been surging in Houston again. There's already another stay-at-home order in Harris county, and I wouldn't be surprised if we get one in our county as well. 
                    <br><br>
                    Spiritual thought!
                    <br><br>
                    Mosiah 4:11
                    11 And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.
                    <br><br>
                    I think it's funny how King Benjamin really tries to convince us how worthless we are without Christ. Like he's like "And He saves you Unworthy Creatures!!!"
                    <br><br>
                    Love y'all 
                    <br><br><br>

                    Hello again everyone! Happy July!
                    <br><br>
                    This week was rather uneventful... we called a lot of people who flaked out on us. But for the 4th of July we made our own hamburgers and deviled eggs and keto raspberry cheesecake! It was very yummy! Then we watched fireworks from our porch! It was awesome!
                    <br><br>
                    We're going to have to push back Lesly's baptism. We're still waiting to hear how bad her knee injury is.
                    <br><br>
                    Ivory is progressing quite well! We got him to "church" yesterday and he wants to get baptized! Hopefully his health allows him to get baptized.
                    <br><br>
                    I had Lesson Pass Offs this week and they went well. It was kind stressful since I didn't know that my mission president was literally going to be sitting there listening the entire time... but turns out I need to work on my How to Begin Teaching. My President said I speak Spanish like I've already been here a year!
                    <br><br>
                    We had a stake-wide devotional last night and they announced that in-person church will be starting up soon! There are a million rules but still pretty exciting.
                    <br><br>
                    Love you all
