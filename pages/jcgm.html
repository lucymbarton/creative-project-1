                      Buenos días!! 
                      <br><br>
                      Como están? 
                      <br><br>
                      This week was pretty eventful to say the least. 
                      <br><br>
                      Last Monday was pretty rough. Started out with not getting much sleep and then crying at the mission office. I got to meet with President Guthrie and he gave me a priesthood blessing. It was really special and talked about Heavenly Father's love for me and awareness of me and said that I'd be able to use my Spanish after the mission to help a lot of people! Yay. 
                      <br><br>
                      But anyways, I'm back in Jones Creek/Grand Mission with Hermana Crandall. She told me about what happened with her companion. Something about some inappropriate relationships and putting makeup on for four hours every day... So I'm glad to be able to save Hermana Crandall from that. Hermana Crandall is really fun and we have a similar sense of humor. We work well together and we like to rock out in the car to Jesus songs. 
                      <br><br>
                      Other news is that I'm an STL (Sister Training Leader) now. That basically means I have to help fill out the spreadsheet about how the recent converts in the zone are doing and I have to be on long accountability calls on Sunday nights. Also we go on exchanges with all the sisters in the zone and make sure that they're all doing okay. 
                      <br><br>
                      Tuesday we got to teach our friend Gift about temples. She really liked it and she watched the Rome Italy temple tour. Later that day we were able to go volunteer at a place called Reining Strength where they do horseback riding for people who have disabilities. We were side walkers so we walked along side the horse to make sure that the rider didn't fall off. There was a food truck at our apartment complex that night and I ordered 2 tacos in Spanish. Also I had bought sushi already to eat that day so I had tacos and sushi for dinner and if that didn't boost my mental health I don't know what else would lol. 
                      <br><br>
                      We pranked the elders by putting sticky notes all over their car. :) 
                      <br><br>
                      Wednesday we had district council and discussed about a talk called "What is Truth" From like the 1980s. Then we had a lesson with our new friend Deneatry who was a self referral! She is going through a hard time in life and she was praying for help and then she looked at her phone and saw the comeuntochrist.org ad and saw it as an answer to her prayer! She is awesome and is loving learning with us!! 
                      <br><br>
                      Thursday I got to go to zone conference. It was pretty good. I took a lot of notes. Also I got to see Elder Satterfield again!!!!!!!!!! He gave me 2 cookies lol. I talked to him all about what had happened to me with the ET and then I had to leave and then I realized I didn't even ask him how he was doing... Feels bad. 
                      <br><br>
                      I went on exchanged with Hermana Beal in H4 after zone conference. We taught a couple kids, got chicken curry for dinner, and then helped a lady with a disabled son clean her house! It was a fun exchange. 
                      <br><br>
                      Friday we had a pass off lesson with Tim and the elders in Katy. We started off talking about Lehi's dream. I explained how the fruit represents Jesus Christ and Tim asked how he can "eat the fruit" in his life. So we plunged head first into the Gospel of Jesus Christ and Tim said that he wants to be baptized! The elders set a date for him to work towards of May 15! Yay for Tim!!! 
                      <br><br>
                      We also taught Princess and Princeton on Friday about the priesthood. Princess had a great question about why girls don't pass the Sacrament! We explained about how men and women are equal opposites. One of the members that we had with us explained it like as if one was the brain and the other was the heart, the body couldn't survive without both of them! It's the same with the church! 
                      <br><br>
                      A member brought us Cane's on Friday :) 
                      <br><br>
                      Saturday we made a butt ton of cookies. 
                      <br><br>
                      Sunday we watched the Stake Conference broadcast. President and Sister Guthrie spoke. President kept saying "Elders and Sisters" instead of "Brothers and Sisters". 
                      <br><br>
                      Pretty much it. 
                      <br><br>
                      Spiritual Thought:
                      <br><br>
                      1 Nephi 4:3
                      3 Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an angel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.
                      <br><br>
                      I started my 8th time through the Book of Mormon on my mission this week! Back in 1 Nephi. I feel like I relate to Nephi a lot in this verse, especially as my testimony in Jesus Christ and His restored gospel deepens. I have seen and experienced so many things that prove to me that Jesus is real, that God is among us, that this is His church. I would literally die for the Book of Mormon if I had to. All the evidence is right here and you just have to read it and pray about it!! "behold YE KNOW that this is true... Wherefore can ye doubt?" I know that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I know that He loves us. I know that we can change through Jesus Christ. 
                      <br><br>
                      Love yall
                      <br><br>
                      Les quiero mucho
                      <br><br><br>
