                      Buenos días! Como están?
                        <br><br>
                       This week was pretty slow. But General Conference was so awesome! Missionaries really look forward to it because it's just such an uplifting experience. And we get to basically sit and watch TV for 8 hours. I miss watching TV lol.
                       <br><br>
                       Monday I got transferred over here to Missouri City. I am living in the same complex that I was trained in, and that was really weird to come back here. We rarely left the apartment when I was training due to COVID, so there are a lot of memories here. We met up with the district at a park and played some card games. Then we got In n Out burger!!
                       <br><br>
                       Tuesday a member brought us Panda Express! The lessons we were going to have all fell through, so we went and tried to visit some formerly taught people and "tear up the streets" as Hermana Tea says. Aka Street contacting.
                       <br><br>
                       Wednesday was district council. The church is almost 30 minutes away from our apartment, something I have never experienced before. The same thing happened where our lessons fell through and we walked the streets and tried to visit formers.
                       <br><br>
                       Thursday we went to pick up lunch from Hermana Garcia and she told us that her neighbors had killed her dog! It was really sad. She took us back to where she had buried her dog. And then she gave us carne asada. (Which literally just means roasted meat like a roast in the crock pot but they also use it for BBQs) We walked around another neighborhood and saw 2 dead snakes.
                       <br><br>
                       Friday we taught 2 English classes and a total of 3 ladies came. We went and visited formers again and a lady came to the door and I asked her if she liked to read the Bible and then I introduced the Book of Mormon and shared my testimony of it and she didn't want it. I felt bad and wondered what I could've done differently to convince her to read the book, but I think her heart just wasn't open to the spirit at that point.
                       <br><br>
                       General Conference was amazing! We took our extra mattress and extra 4 pillows and made a makeshift couch in our living room to watch it. Hermana Garcia made us papusas!! I Some of my favorite talks were Elder Uchtdorf, Sister Joy D. Jones, President Eyering, President Nelson's about faith, Elder Christofferson, and Elder Rasband's. I'm really excited for the talks to come out on Gospel Library so I can study them again. We watched the Sunday morning session at the church in Spanish. I understood basically everything, which is something I would not have been able to do a year ago!
                       <br><br>
                       Spiritual Thought:
                       <br><br>
                       Alma 60:11
                       <br><br>
                       11 Behold, could ye suppose that ye could sit upon your thrones, and because of the exceeding goodness of God ye could do nothing and he would deliver you? Behold, if ye have supposed this ye have supposed in vain.
                       <br><br>
                       I finished Alma again this morning. It's a long book. I like this verse because it explains that even though our God is really really good and merciful, He needs us to DO stuff. He knows that if He did everything for us, we wouldn't learn or progress. We would just sit there and get fat, probably.
                       <br><br>
                       Les quiero
                       <br><br>
                       Love yall
                       <br><br><br>
