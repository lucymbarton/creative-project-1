                    <p>Hello friends and family!! <br>

                    I got to the MTC last wednesday and it feels like I have been here for a lifetime!!! Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday all took FOREVER to go by.<br>
                    <br>
                    Because of the corona virus, a lot of things I was excited to do here in the MTC are not allowed. The temple is closed, they are not allowing choir practices, all our devotionals and sacrament meetings are broadcast to us in our classrooms, and we can't touch anyone!!
                    <br><br>
                    There was an earthquake this morning. It was pretty weak here.
                    <br><br>
                    On Wednesday, while we were on the way to the MTC, we got the email telling us that Missionary training starting March 16th will be online. So I feel really special and blessed to be here in the MTC instead of Zooming into all of my classes and workshops. Honestly that would suck a lot. I know that I am here for a reason.
                    <br><br>
                    My companion is Hermana Collins. She is from Martinsville Virginia and she is going to Ecuador. She has the cutest Southern Belle accent. She is so sweet. Hermana Collins also left a boyfriend/"best friend" at home and we have a lot in common. I know that she is my companion for a reason. The other sisters in my room are Hermana Macevic and Hermana Smith. They are both going to Sacramento. Everyone in our district is really nice and really funny. Our teachers are Hermano Astorga and Hermana Rindlisbacher. We love Hermano Astorga. He is really funny. When something bad happens, he says "I am going to get diabetes!" LOL "Voy a tener diabetes"
                    <br><br>
                    Our first exercise time was on Saturday, and we went to the gym and played volleyball. It was really fun! We were all really excited to go play it again, but on monday the gym was closed and we had to go play kickball in the field across the street. It was still fun, but we were sad that we could not play in the gym. 
                    <br><br>
                    All of the Hermanas in my room are really nice and loving and hilarious. I was nervous that my companion and the other sisters would be mean or rude but they are all really nice and funny! And I was scared no one would know about Tik tok but we talk about tik toks alll the time. We have a lot of fun. 
                    <br><br>
                    Please email me!! How is your life now that Corona es loco?? I can read emails every day and it always makes me smile to get one. I can only reply on Wednesdays.
                    <br><br>
                    Love and miss you all. I'd like to reassure you that missionary work will still press on despite all the quarrentines and travel bans. We are still being trained here in the Missionary Training Center. I know that I am here for a reason and I know that God has a plan for all of us and loves us so much. Yo se que Dios es nuestro Padre Celestial. Yo se que Dios tiene un plan por todos. Yo se que Jesucristo es nuestro salvador. En el nombre de Jesucristo Amen
                    <br><br>
                    Love you all!!
                    <br><br><br>

                      This has honestly been THE craziest week of my life. Que loco.
                      <br><br>
                      On Thursday Hermana Collins and I had our second TRC. That's where we meet with a non-member (or a member pretending to be a non-member) and teach them a lesson. Our first two were in English. The first one we felt didn't go very well but actually went okay from the feedback that we got. But the second one we had was honestly sooo awesome. For our first TRC we met with a guy named Joseph who goes to BYU. We were supposed to meet with him again the next day, but he apparently couldn't make it so we met with a girl named Jessica who is going to UVU. She was about our age, 19 or 20. She said that she wanted to strengthen her relationship with God, especially with how crazy and scary the world is right now. We had prepared a lesson for Joseph about how to receive personal revelation and how to recognize the spirit and God's hand in your life. We shared it with Jessica and it was perfect for her. Hermana Collins and I could so tangibly feel God's love for her that I actually started crying in the lesson. Hermana Collins was talking for a while and then looked at me to say something and I wasn't sure what I was going to say, but I just opened my mouth and words came out. Neither Hermana Collins or I remember really what I said but we just remember that it was really powerful. We explained to Jessica what it feels like to feel the spirit and asked if she thought she had ever felt the spirit before. She said that when she was deciding which college to go to, nothing up in Washington was working out for her but when her uncle suggested that she move down to Utah and go to UVU, everything felt right. It was soo AWESOME to teach Jessica. After the closing prayer of our lesson, Jessica was crying. We left her our emails because we'll probably never see her again.
                      <br><br>
                      On Friday we had our first workshop over Zoom. I don't remember what it was about but I liked making funny faces at the missionaries in our district LOL.
                      <br><br>
                      On Saturday all of the Hermanas in my district wore pink! Hermana Collins and I polished the pianos again for service. Saturday was our last day that we were able to go out to the field for exercise time and the Elders in our district didn't play with us. They played with some blonde Hermana that we don't really like very much. Us Hermanas were butt hurt.
                      <br><br>
                      Sunday was the day that changed everything. It all seemed normal until they announced in our broadcasted sacrament meeting that ALL missionaries were invited to attend the Departure Devotional that night. So naturally we all thought that we were all getting sent home. That, or President Nelson was going to speak in the devotional or something. So we were all crazy anxious all day. And then we watched the devotional and not until the very end of it did they say "oh yeah, let's pull up this powerpoint. Every missionary in the MTC will either travel to their mission, get reassigned, or go home by next Saturday, hopefully next Friday. Y'all can call your family tonight and let them know."
                      <br><br>
                      We all didn't really know how to feel. Most of the missionaries in my district were supposed to go to Ecuador. So they really had NO IDEA what was going to happen to them. I assumed that I would be sent to Houston by the end of the week. Our Branch President, President Durrant (Played in the NBA and spoke in General Conference. He was the "Ponderize" guy) basically just left us. He said "Well, I guess I'll never see you guys again! BYE!" and he just walked out the door. Elder Houtz said "Can we get a picture??" and President Durrant and his wife just kept on walking... We've been making fun of that all week.
                      <br><br>
                      So after that happened we were supposed to have our regular Sunday devotional and then a Devotional Review after that but we all just sat there and cried and called our parents and talked to each other. We decided that we should pray as a district, and then the Elders offered to give us all blessings. Elder Reed gave me my blessing. He is going to Texas Houston South with me. My blessing was really special. It said that I should have peace, that my family will be okay at home, that there are many people in the field waiting to hear from me, and that the language will come smoothly to me and that people will understand me. I BAWLED. I was so worried that I would get sent home or that I'd get to the field and not know how to talk to anyone or say anything in Spanish. But know I know for sure that I am meant to be here. There were four elders in the circle giving us our blessing, but they said that they definitely felt more than four people there. Our Elders could barely stand after giving us our blessings. I cannot deny the power of the priesthood.
                      <br><br>
                      Monday was a weird day. None of us knew where we were going to go or when we were going to leave. We were all sad because we thought we'd have 6 weeks to learn and 6 weeks with all our new friends. But now we have to leave the MTC. 
                      <br><br>
                      Yesterday we found out that Hermana Macevic had to go home because of medical reasons. Hermano Astorga gave us a crazy good lesson about how God trusts us and we are SO prepared to enter the field. We all cried. We took pictures with Hermano Astorga before Hermana Macevic had to leave. We all went to lunch and then us Hermanas went to see Hermana Macevic off. It was really sad and I miss her so much already. Then we had another Zoom meeting. We phoned in from our residence and I ate licorice the whole time and hoped other missionaries were laughing at my screen. Elder Reed screenshotted me tearing my licorice apart LOL. After our meeting we had dinner and then we listened to our Elders play the piano. 
                      <br><br>
                      Then we went over to T4 to listen to the Tuesday devotional. We got on the elevator with our whole district, the other Elders from our branch, and some other sisters. Elder Silva said "Everyone jump on 3!" And Elder Silva has to be like 6 foot 4 and over 300 pounds. He literally hit his head on the ceiling... The elevator fell like an entire floor. And then we got stuck on the elevator for ALMOST AN HOUR. Talk about social distancing am I right?? We were stuck on the elevator with 17 people and it got SOO HOT. We missed all but 15 minutes of the devotional. When we finally got off the elevator, there was a security guard who asked us for our names and our district numbers. Then he told us that he liked our rendition of "Country Roads."
                      <br><br>
                      Oh and this morning I found out that I will leave for Houston on Friday at 1:45. So I guess I'm going to Texas!! And I'll be on a plane alone with Elder Reed for 2 hours and 55 minutes. God really trusts me I guess LOL.
                      <br><br>
                      Yo se que Dios nos ama.
