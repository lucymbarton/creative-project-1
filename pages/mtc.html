                    <p>Hello friends and family!! <br>

                    I got to the MTC last wednesday and it feels like I have been here for a lifetime!!! Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday all took FOREVER to go by.<br>
                    <br>
                    Because of the corona virus, a lot of things I was excited to do here in the MTC are not allowed. The temple is closed, they are not allowing choir practices, all our devotionals and sacrament meetings are broadcast to us in our classrooms, and we can't touch anyone!!
                    <br><br>
                    There was an earthquake this morning. It was pretty weak here.
                    <br><br>
                    On Wednesday, while we were on the way to the MTC, we got the email telling us that Missionary training starting March 16th will be online. So I feel really special and blessed to be here in the MTC instead of Zooming into all of my classes and workshops. Honestly that would suck a lot. I know that I am here for a reason.
                    <br><br>
                    My companion is Hermana Collins. She is from Martinsville Virginia and she is going to Ecuador. She has the cutest Southern Belle accent. She is so sweet. Hermana Collins also left a boyfriend/"best friend" at home and we have a lot in common. I know that she is my companion for a reason. The other sisters in my room are Hermana Macevic and Hermana Smith. They are both going to Sacramento. Everyone in our district is really nice and really funny. Our teachers are Hermano Astorga and Hermana Rindlisbacher. We love Hermano Astorga. He is really funny. When something bad happens, he says "I am going to get diabetes!" LOL "Voy a tener diabetes"
                    <br><br>
                    Our first exercise time was on Saturday, and we went to the gym and played volleyball. It was really fun! We were all really excited to go play it again, but on monday the gym was closed and we had to go play kickball in the field across the street. It was still fun, but we were sad that we could not play in the gym. 
                    <br><br>
                    All of the Hermanas in my room are really nice and loving and hilarious. I was nervous that my companion and the other sisters would be mean or rude but they are all really nice and funny! And I was scared no one would know about Tik tok but we talk about tik toks alll the time. We have a lot of fun. 
                    <br><br>
                    Please email me!! How is your life now that Corona es loco?? I can read emails every day and it always makes me smile to get one. I can only reply on Wednesdays.
                    <br><br>
                    Love and miss you all. I'd like to reassure you that missionary work will still press on despite all the quarrentines and travel bans. We are still being trained here in the Missionary Training Center. I know that I am here for a reason and I know that God has a plan for all of us and loves us so much. Yo se que Dios es nuestro Padre Celestial. Yo se que Dios tiene un plan por todos. Yo se que Jesucristo es nuestro salvador. En el nombre de Jesucristo Amen
                    <br><br>
                    Love you all!!
                    <br><br><br>
                    Hermana Barton</p>
