                        Buenos días! Como están?
                        <br><br>
                         This week was full of service opportunities and packing up Hermana  Crandall. She will be home today! President called Saturday night and  let me know that I will be training this transfer! I will be picking  her up on Tuesday and I have no idea who she is, but I am excited! I  am spending the night with Sister Stewart until we pick up our new  missionaries tomorrow!
                         <br><br>
                         Last P-day was pretty fun! We went with the district to Terry Hershey  park and walked along the river. Then we went to HEB and all got a  pint of ice cream and then we went to a cool park and ate our ice  cream and went down a slide. Fun times.
                         <br><br>
                         So if you actually read my last email you'll remember that I told  Joann that Joseph Smith didn't shoot anyone, turns out that he did and  I just forgot about it... But I was a little stressed about how we  were going to explain all of this to Joann. I read through the Saints  book a little bit and discussed with my companion. And then on Tuesday  we had a devotional from President Scott, stake president of the  Friendswood stake, and he just had us make a list of all the things  that we know are true and then connected everything back to Joseph  Smith. So if we know the priesthood power is real, we know that Joseph  Smith was a prophet of God because the priesthood was restored through  him. If we know that families are eternal, we believe that Joseph  Smith was a prophet of God because that truth was revealed through  him, etc. It was really awesome and just what I needed to really  strengthen my testimony of Joseph Smith so we could explain everything  to Joann. However, when we went over to Joanne's this week she told us  that she didn't believe God had ever called prophets. She said she  thinks Moses and Noah and Abraham were just men. When we invited her  to pray about it she said she wasn't willing to. But she's been coming  to church for two years so we're still trying to figure out where her  concern is deep down.
                         <br><br>
                         Thursday we got to have a zone service at our horse place Reining  Strength! We all swept and wiped down rails and the outside of horse  stalls in preparation for their fundraiser event Derby Days. It was so  fun! And the horses were being so cute when we tried to clean their  stalls lol. We also were able to go to the Grand Mission relief  society activity and we all went around and shared something that we  had learned in the past year and it was just so amazing to feel of the  other women's testimonies.
                         <br><br>
                         We were able to help a new-move-in family paint their house this week  and that was pretty fun. But it turned my jeans into painting jeans.
                         <br><br>
                         Sunday we had a special multi-stake conference! It was all online, but  Elder Soares of the twelve apostles spoke to us! We were able to get 7  of our people to watch it! It was amazing and they talked about love,  ministering, faith, and letting God prevail.
                         <br><br>
                         I dropped off Hermana Crandall at the mission office last night to go  home today! She is ready and she is going to do amazing things. I will  see her at BYU in the fall.
                         <br><br>
                         Spiritual Thought:
                         <br><br>
                         Ether 12:8-9
                         8 But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world,  and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way that thereby  others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might hope  for those things which they have not seen.
                         9 Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if  ye will but have faith.
                         <br><br>
                         I have loved pondering about the power of faith! I know that faith is  how we gain access to God's power. I think it makes so much sense  because there are a lot of people who don't have access to the  priesthood but still see many miracles in their lives because of their  faith in God and in Jesus Christ. I think the "Heavenly gift" in these  verses means the grace of Jesus Christ and His healing power. I know  that I have hope through Him.
                         <br><br>
                         Love yall
                         <br><br>
                         Les quiero mucho
                         <br><br><br>
