                        Buenos dias! Como estan?
                        <br><br>
                         This week was the first week of my entire mission that we have been  able to eat with members! It was such a wild experience. Lol I almost  felt naked without a mask on.
                         <br><br>
                         Last Monday we played pickle ball and volleyball and then we tried to  go to Cane's but it was closed because of Memorial Day so we went to  Chickfila. We went to the church and played some basketball games. I  worked on my 3 point shot and Elder Curtis taught us BEEF (Balance,  Elbows, Eyes, Follow through) and I actually go to be pretty good. I  am LeBron James.
                         <br><br>
                         Tuesday we had a call with our friend Ora and when we tried to explain  the priesthood to her she told us to not put ourselves down and that  we are the priesthood. She said she thinks the priesthood is when  people get together and share the gospel. Hopefully we'll be able to  clarify that one. We also went to the park to try to talk to people  and we talked to these two really nice African-American ladies and  gave them each a Book of Mormon and one of them even smacked a  mosquito off of my leg for me lol.
                         <br><br>
                         Wednesday we had district council. We were talking about the  invitations from Zone Conference and one was actually the invitation  from the prophet to ponder on what we would do if we had more faith. I  figured out that if I had more faith I wouldn't worry or stress as  much as I do. I think it's just become the way I think since I've been  doing it for so long, but I'm going to try to trust God more.
                         <br><br>
                         Thursday we had our first meal with members. We went to the Hibberts  and they fed us tropical bowls with rice, chicken, pineapples, sweet  potatoes? and peanut sauce, among other things. It was good. They gave  us some asian fish waffles filled with custard for dessert. We shared  a short message about the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ  with them.
                         <br><br>
                         Friday had dinner with our stake president. (Nobody told me that he  was in our ward until we were talking to him last week). President  Smith fed us takeout from a fancy Mexican place called Lopez's. They  had a family member over for dinner who is not of our faith! But we  didn't even realized until we started our lesson about the plan of  salvaiton. But it went well!
                         <br><br>
                         We had a lesson with our friend Joann about fasting. She has been  coming to church for two years but hasn't been baptized yet. We  explained why we fast. She said no one had explained to her the reason  we fast before! She fasted with us on Sunday! :)
                         <br><br>
                         Saturday we visited a lot of people. We tried to visit this girl named  Ashley who had requested a Book of Mormon about a year ago but we  drove half an hour out to her town and then she lived in a gated  neighborhood. We told the man at the kiosk who we were there to visit  and gave him my drivers lisence. He proceeded to call their house and  say "Yeah there's someone named Lucy Marie Barton at the gate for you"  and I was so embarrassed!! They would have no idea who I was and now  they just think I'm a creeper. I'm sure somebody was about to call the  cops on us or something. Long story short we had to leave without  visiting her and wasted an entire hour of our day.
                         <br><br>
                         We had dinner on Saturday with a member we visit a lot named Tiffany.  She made us chicken enchiladas and homemade salsa and it was so good.  We roleplayed a few principles with her. Good times.
                         <br><br>
                         Sunday a man showed up to Jones Creek sacrament who was not a member  and he bore his testimony! His name is Peter and we got his number and  set up a time to call on Thursday.
                         <br><br>
                         That's about it for this week. I got the email this morning that I got  My Plan. (My Plan is an online course for missionaries at the end of  their mission so they can figure out what they're going to do for the  rest of their life) I don't feel old enough to be doing this. But Okay.
                         <br><br>
                         Spiritual thought:
                         <br><br>
                         2 Nephi 10:20
                         20 And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God has  given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us remember  him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are  not cast off; nevertheless, we have been driven out of the land of our  inheritance; but we have been led to a better land, for the Lord has  made the sea our path, and we are upon an isle of the sea.
                         <br><br>
                         Because God loves us, he gives us knowledge. I have seen and felt his  power and love as I have gained a greater understanding of His  doctrine and of the scriptures. I feel like this scripture is for me  as I try to increase my trust and faith in Him. I know that he loves  me, so why would I hang down my head?
                         <br><br>
                         Love yall
                         <br><br>
                         les quiero
                         <br><br>
                         ps. sorry didn't take many pictures this week
                         <br><br>
                         pps. how far away do you think that plane is?
                        
                        
                    </p>
