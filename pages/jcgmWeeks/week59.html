                        Buenos dias! Como estan?
                        <br><br>
                         This week was exhausting! We had to do two sets of exchanges (where we switch companions for 24 hours) since they couldn't do exchanges while Sister Ralphs was here and we didn't want to do them on the last week of the transfer.
                         <br><br>
                         Last Monday we had Sisters' P-day and all the sisters in the zone got together at a boba place and it was pretty fun.
                         <br><br>
                         Tuesday we got to go back to the Reining Strength horse place and we did the leader training where we learned how to lead the horses around! It was so fun! But my horse kept kicking dirt into my shoes so now every time I put my shoes on my feet get dirty.
                         <br><br>
                         Wednesday we had district council and then we had our exhanges with Hermana West and Hermana Ashby. I got to be with Hermana West here in my area. It was so fun since Hermana West and I were actually companions in Sealy last summer! She has grown and changed so much since we were companions and I am so proud of her!
                         <br><br>
                         Thursday, Hermana Crandall and I went to teach our friend Joann with a member Sister Brimhall. Joann has been taught by missionaries for well over 2 years and we're just trying to figure out where her concern or misunderstandings are. We started back at the beginning with the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. She said "yeah I've heard all of this before. But I don't believe in Joseph Smith." When we asked why, she started talking about when Peter cut the ear off of that guard and Jesus healed it back on. She was under the impression that when Joseph Smith was in Carthage jail that he shot someone and then tried to escape out of the window. We told her that that is not true, that Joseph Smith was a kind man who always tried his best to follow what Jesus Christ had told him and he was martyred that day, he didn't shoot anyone. I'm not sure what Joann has been watching on TV, but you can't believe everything you watch on TV.
                         <br><br>
                         Friday we had exchanges with Sister Vlam and Hermana House. I was with Hermana House in my area. Hermana House and I were also companions once upon a time when I very first came to Houston and spent 3 weeks with Hermana House and Hermana Rich in H8 while I finished my MTC training. Those were hard times, but it was definitely fun to be with Hermana House again. We had a really busy day! We met with our friends Princess and Princeton and they said that they feel ready to be baptized after the lesson that we had last week about the priesthood! We talked about temples and eternal families and they really want to be sealed to their family. When we were getting up to leave, Princeton (10 years old) said "I have a question, this might be a little late to ask since we've been doing it for so long, but what are you supposed to think about when you pray?" wow it was so precious! They are now preparing to be baptized on May 15th!
                         <br><br>
                         Saturday I got to watch the baptism of my friend Andrea from Galveston on Zoom!! I'm so happy for her and she was so happy to get baptized! She has such a strong relationship with God and a testimony of the restored gospel. She is going to do great things as a member of His church. Next step is the temple!!
                         <br><br>
                         Sunday we had a lot of meetings. We're over 2 wards so we had 2 sacrament meetings. This week is the only week I had to meet the members before Hermana Crandall goes home because last week was stake conference and next week is a special regional conference. So I tried to talk to everyone and write down their names so I could remember them. It was exhausting.
                         <br><br>
                         Spiritual thought:
                         <br><br>
                         2 Nephi 4:20
                         20 My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep.
                         <br><br>
                         This is Nephi talking about how he has been supported in all of his many trials. I know that I have been supported by God throughout my mission. Being away from home is hard. Facing rejection is hard. Trying to explain the gospel in a simple way that will bring the spirit is hard. Having a companion is hard. Following the commandments and standards is hard. Facing the future and reality is hard. But I know that God's hands are lifting me up. There is no way I would have made it this far on my mission, through all of the hard times where I just wanted to stop existing for a while, without the strengthening power that Jesus Christ gives me through his grace and Atonement. I love Him and I know Him.
                         <br><br>
                         Love yall
                         <br><br>
                         Les quiero mucho
                         <br><br><br>
                         Hermana Barton
