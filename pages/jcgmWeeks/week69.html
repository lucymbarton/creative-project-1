                        Buenos d&iacute;as! C&oacute;mo est&aacute;n? 
                        <br><br>
                        This week was weird and long and hard and good. 
                        <br><br>
                        Last Monday we went bowling with our district! Idk how, but I creamed everyone. You just gotta throw the ball straight. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
                        <br><br>
                        Tuesday morning we got a text from President Guthrie saying he wanted to come visit for a final goodbye. We freaked out. Well, I freaked out and my companions told me to chill out lol. It was really nice and we got to say goodbye and President Guthrie even let us give him a hug! But when I think about it now it makes me sad because I miss him. 
                        <br><br>
                        Tuesday night we had dinner with the Wilson family (in the Jones Creek ward) and Sister Wilson told us how she met her husband at EFY. And how he proposed to her on a yacht. crazy.
                        <br><br>
                        Tuesday night we got a referral from some elders for a guy named Mike and it turned out that he lived literally down the hall from us!
                        <br><br>
                        Wednesday our mission presidents switched. Our new mission president is President Richards. He is from Utah and he used to be a lawyer for the church. He has a few kids at home but their youngest is 10. We have had a couple zoom calls with them but we are going to meet them in person next week at our welcome conferences. 
                        <br><br>
                        Wednesday we had district council and then for lunch we made lettuce wraps in honor of Sister Guthrie and all the lettuce wraps she made me lol. Our friend James had his baptismal interview and passed! Then after that pretty much everything fell through so we decided to drive all the way out to Orchard, Texas to visit a lady named Lupe. It was a 30 minute drive and luckily she was home and let us in!
                        <br><br>
                        Thursday, Hermana Dyer had her first session of physical therapy for her elbow. Hermana Murdock and I had to go to Starbucks while she did it because they don't allow visitors in the doctor's office. After that, we decided to go visit some formerly taught people in an apartment complex and we ended up seeing a guy who worked at the physical therapy place and who lived in the apartment complex that we went to and we were even going to knock on his apartment because someone who had lived there before had spoken with the missionaires. coincidence??? You'll get baptized some day, Mike!
                        <br><br>
                        Friday we had some good lessons with Gift and Zach and James.
                        <br><br>
                        Saturday morning the Grand Mission ward had a fourth of July breakfast that we went to and that was super fun. It was the first ward party I've been to on my mission, actually. It was awesome. We talked with a bunch of members and set up times to go over to their house and share a message. The rest of the day was pretty bleh. We started fasting so for dinner we took a nap instead of eating and then my companions would NOT get out of bed even when I tried to wake them up so I just studied Spanish by myself and felt sorry for myself. 
                        <br><br>
                        But then we went and visited some people and ended up visiting this family who hadn't been to church since COVID. We shared a couple scriptures with them. I thought we should share Helaman 5:12. We asked the dad to read it and he started crying halfway through and could hardly finish the verse. Turned out that it was his mission plaque scripture and it brought back a lot of memories. We invited them to come to church and to spend more time together as a family. They didn't come to church :( but hopefully we will see them next week!
                        <br><br>
                        Sunday was super fun. We went to our four hours of church, had our meetings, and James got baptized! I led the music and Hermana Murdock and I were able to be the witnesses for the baptism. It was really good and the Yawu family had a lot of support. There were so many people there! Yay!
                        <br><br>
                        Spiritual thought:
                        <br><br>
                        3 Nephi 19:23
                        23 And now Father, I pray unto thee for them, and also for all those who shall believe on their words, that they may believe in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one.
                        <br><br>
                        First of all, it brings great comfort to me to know that Jesus prays for me. Second of all, I've been pondering on how when we take the sacrament we're literally taking a symbolic part of Jesus and putting it in us. So basically Jesus becomes a part of us. So when we really meaningfully and intentionally partake of the sacrament, I think that this verse can be true for us. That we can be one with Jesus as He is one with Heavenly Father and then we can all be one together. 
                        <br><br>
                        les quiero
                        <br><br>
                        love yall
