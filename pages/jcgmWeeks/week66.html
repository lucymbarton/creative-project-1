                        Buenos dias! Como estan?
                        <br><br>
                        This week seemed to go by fast.
                        <br><br>
                        Last Monday we went to a burger place with the district and then played some basketball/dodgeball at the church. 
                        <br><br>
                        Tuesday we had a devotional from President Guthrie about being a Yes, If... missionary instead of a No, Because... missionary. I think I usually say "Yes, but..." so I've got some work to do on that lol
                        <br><br>
                        Wednesday we had district council. Afterwards I was just feeling pretty overwhelmed and ended up crying all through lunch. Idk if there was anything in particular I was upset about but it was just the combination of training, being over 2 wards, feeling like our efforts aren't really amounting to much, worrying about going home, and some other things. I called Sister Guthrie and talked things through. Also I realized that all the eating with members had messed up my pill-taking habits. But I felt fine by the next day. It did make it feel like Wednesday only lasted a few hours. 
                        <br><br>
                        Thursday we had lunch and a lesson with a recent convert Rachel and then we had dinner with the Holt family. They gave us BLTs. I don't think I've had a BLT before (mom, correct me if I'm wrong) but it was pretty good. 
                        <br><br>
                        Friday I hit 15 months as a missionary. Today I only have 9 weeks until I go home. I still don't know how to feel about it because I'm excited to go but I know it's going to be so weird and awkward for at least like 2 weeks. We went to Reining Strength and we were going to be sidewalkers but our rider didn't show up so we just did some sweeping. We went and got Pho to celebrate my cumplemes. For dinner we had a lesson with the Mortensen family and they gave us these huge pasta shells full of chicken and brocoli. They have 3 boys in the 0-8 age group so the lesson was fun. 
                        <br><br>
                        Saturday our apartment complex had free muffins. :) We drove out to the farmers market in Fulshear to try to talk to people. We had some good conversations. It wasn't a very big market and it was probably 96 degrees with 100% humidity so we only stayed for about 30 minutes. We got some tamales and some honey sticks :)
                        <br><br>
                        Saturday we had a lesson and dinner with the Price family. They invited some friends over to eat with us who are not of our faith! We shared about the Plan of Salvation and left them with a pamphlet to read. 
                        <br><br>
                        We got news on Saturday that we'll be getting a third companion, Hermana Dyer. She's having surgery today (nothing serious but part of the reason she'll be in a trio with us) so we will pick her up tomorrow. 
                        <br><br>
                        Sunday our wards went back to the 2 hour block at church! Woo. BUt for us we went from 2 hours at church (with 2 sacrament meetings) to 8 hours at church. We got there around 8:30am and left around 3:30pm. We had to church blocks with ward council in between and a coorelation meeting after. It was a lot. 
                        <br><br>
                        Also, Elder Rascon, a member of the Seventy, presided at our Jones Creek sacrament meeting. He wanted to talk to us afterwards so we went in the high council room and had a little meeting with him. We read from Doctrine and Covenants 33 and from 1 Nephi and talked about having faith, failing, recieving revelation, and our divine call as missionaries. It was so special and something that both Hermana Murdock and I needed to hear. 
                        <br><br>
                        We had 3 friends come to church yesterday. Peter, Michael, and Joann. Elder Rascon ended up telling Peter (in front of the entire Elders Quorum) that he is going to get baptized. So we have our work cut out for us since we haven't been able to meet with him yet! He just showed up to church and then the number he gave us didn't work!
                        <br><br>
                        So overall, it was a good week. Yes, being a missionary is hard and weird and awkward most of the time, but there are so many sweet moments where the Spirit testifies to me of the truthfulness of the gospel and the importance of this work. I love being a missionary. 
                        <br><br>
                        Spiritual thought:
                        Jacob 4:9-10
                        <br><br>
                        9 For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth, which earth was created by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will and pleasure?
                        10 Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works.
                        <br><br>
                        Why should we argue with the Lord and His will when He literally has the power to control all things? He knows what He is doing. 
                        <br><br>
                        Les quiero.
                        <br><br>
                        Love yall
                        <br><br><br>
