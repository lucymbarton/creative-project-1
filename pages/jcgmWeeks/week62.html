                        Buenos d&iacute;as! Como estan? 
                        <br><br>
                        This week was pretty good. 
                        <br><br>
                        Monday we played pickleball and it was super fun except that it was like 90 degrees and 100% humidity. But, we went to lunch at this Mexican place called Las Ma&ntilde;anitas and it got some chicken enchiladas and they were good :) 
                        <br><br>
                        Tuesday I hit 14 months as a missionary. A member got us Pablo's for dinner (a really fancy Mexican restaurant right next to our apartment). 
                        <br><br>
                        Wednesday we had district council again! We talked about how to talk to people, which made me feel inadequate but I'm actually a lot better than I used to be. We went walking in the neighborhood right by our apartment and we met a nice old man named Arthur who served in the army and the air force and he was trying to bury the roots of the trees in his yard. 
                        <br><br>
                        Thursday we had Atonement training!! It was so great. Basically we got to go to the mission office with all of the other brand new missionaries and their trainers and President Guthrie, President Heaton, and Sister Guthrie talked to us about the Atonement. The new missionaries also got an opportunity to share the first vision in English or in their assigned language. Hermana Murdock was too nervous but she knows it pretty well. We got sandwiches for lunch. Hermana Murdock also got her phone! I added her to all of the mission chats and then she sent a smiley face in the THSM chat with all the missionaries on it... Only President and Sister Guthrie are supposed to post in that chat!! üò¨ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But it's okay we just un sent it. We had a training call that night where we played a trivia game with the missionary standards and we won. 
                        <br><br>
                        Friday we went to the horse place Reining Strength and helped with side walking! That evening we went to the Passewe's with the Holts and taught about the baptismal covenants and answered any of their last minute questions. They are so cute. Princeton wanted to know what the armor of God meant. 
                        <br><br>
                        Saturday was the baptism! We filled up the font, but there was a slow leak so we had to turn the water on a couple more times but no worries, there was still enough water in there when they got baptized. I was chorister, gave a talk on baptism, we taught the restoration during intermission, and Hermana Murdock gave the closing prayer. Brother Passewe, their dad, gave the talk on the Holy Ghost and he expressed his gratitude to everyone in the ward for supporting his family, especially when he and his wife aren't able to come to church very often because of their jobs. They were also confirmed that day since their dad wouldn't be able to come to church the next day. Princeton has a desire to be a missionary! Princess is going to influence so many people with her kind heart and now with the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost! 
                        <br><br>
                        Sunday we went to church and I was getting worried because the Passewes hadn't shown up yet, and also I saw our bishop and I realized that we forgot to bring the baptismal records for him to sign. And then no less than President Jeremy Guthrie showed up to our Sacrament meeting. I about peed myself lol. Thankfully, the Passewes came in a little bit late. After the meeting, President gave Princess and Princeton signed baseball cards (only after having to run out to his car to grab his autograph pen) It was cute. I am going to be sad when President and Sister Guthrie finish their mission and go home next month. 
                        <br><br>
                        Well, that's the week. 
                        <br><br>
                        Spiritual thought:
                        Alma 37:34
                        34 Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.
                        <br><br>
                        It is hard to never be weary of good works, but I think this scripture is so true. While I've been on my mission, I have learned the importance of humility and submitting myself to the will of God and trusting that it is the best thing for me. I've been through hard times, rejection, anxiety, some depression, homesickness, but I know that even in the hardest of times I can have faith and hope in the plan of God. I know that in the eternal perspective, all these things will work out and they will be for my good. I love being able to step back and look at the big picture and to know that God is there, always has been, and always will be. 
                        <br><br>
                        Les quiero mucho
                        <br><br>
                        Love yall
                        <br><br><br>
