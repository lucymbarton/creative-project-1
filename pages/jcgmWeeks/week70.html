                        Buenos dias! Como estan?
                        <br><br>
                        This week was Good!
                        <br><br>
                        On Tuesday and Wednesday I went on exchanges with Sister Vlam in Eldridge Park. It was literally the best exchange ever. We went to a smoothie place for lunch and then we went and visited some of their referrals and we were able to chat in the car about all the things we've learned on our missions and talked about my plans for after. We had dinner with a cute newly wed couple and then we were early for our next lesson so we went walking around the neighborhood and I had the perfect OYM. This lady was in her driveway getting stuff out of her black Subaru Forester and I started talking to her about how my dad has the same car and she was like "I hate this car!" and eventually she wasn't interested in our message but she gave us free ice cream :)
                        <br><br>
                        Wednesday we had a couple lessons with members. Sister Wilson made us yummy tacos. We shared a good Plan of Salvation lesson with the Hawkins family and they gave us root beer floats. 
                        <br><br>
                        Thursday Hermana Dyer had physical therapy again so Hermana Murdock and I went to the library and did language study. We went to Chipotle for lunch and then we practiced our musical number for welcome conference. We sang "I Know that My Redeemer Lives" the EFY version and came up with our own harmony. 
                        <br><br>
                        We started teaching this couple Mike and Esther who live in our apartment complex and they seemed to be really interested and had great questions, but by the end of the week they told us we had answered all of their questions and they didn't want to meet again. :(
                            <br><br>
                        Friday we had Welcome Conference with President and Sister Richards!! It was good and edifying. Their family is so cute! We sang our song and it went well. President Richards asked me to bare my testimony. I talked about how when we take the sacrament it's like we're putting a little bit of Jesus in us every week. Plus I got the news that I GET TO GO TO THE TEMPLE!!! On July 23!! I literally cried when they told me. I'm so beyond excited :')
                        <br><br>
                        Sunday we had our interviews with President Richards. Mine went well. He's definitely not President Guthrie but he has all the same goals and purposes so he's basically the same. 
                        <br><br>
                        Spiritual Thought:
                        <br><br>
                        Joshua 1:16-17
                        16 Â¶ And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
                        17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
                        <br><br>
                        So Joshua was the prophet right after Moses. Pretty big shoes to fill. But the people committed to follow him. President Richards shared Joshua 3:5 with us at the conference that talks about Sanctifying yourself. I thought it was cute because President Richards has had to come in after President Guthrie and it's similar to Moses and Joshua where both of them were called of God to serve us and now President Guthrie is gone and it's President Richards' turn and I'll follow him now. 
                        <br><br>
                        Les quiero
                        <br><br>
                        love yall :)
                        <br><br><br>
