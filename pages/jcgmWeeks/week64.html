                        <br><br>
                        This week we had zone conference and we had our final interviews with President Guthrie before he leaves and we get our new President, President Richards on June 30th. It's bittersweet. 
                        <br><br>
                        Last Monday was Hermana Murdock's 2 month mark as a missionary. For some reason the sisters thought that it was her birthday... so they got her a balloon and a card. We went and got sushi to celebrate meeting our OYM goal and our waitress heard us talking about it and then brought Hermana Murdock a birthday dessert. With the new COVID rules we are now allowed to use the church buildings on P-day! So we played some volleyball at our church and it was awesome. 
                        <br><br>
                        Tuesday I put the new church protection software on my phone which meant I had to do a factory reset and that took way longer than it should have. We were able to go visit this lady Michelle who is a member and is married to someone that we are teaching, but we hadn't been able to get in contact with them for a while. Turns out that her husband, Christian, has been gone for work for about 5 weeks! crazy. But she has a little baby who was born in February and Michelle is tired. We are glad we got to go over. 
                        <br><br>
                        Wednesday we were able to teach both Ora and Deneatry over the phone with members present. They have been hard to get in contact with too because of their work schedules, but both of the lessons went really well and they both seem very interested and have a lot of potential. Ora is loving what she is reading out of the Book of Mormon and Deneatry said she really wants the Gift of the Holy Ghost!
                        <br><br>
                        Thursday was zone conference!! It was so good. President Guthrie has been talking to us a lot lately about how the doctrine is always the answer. He had us read a talk from Elder Bednar about it and it was really good. He also quotes Joseph Smith who said that he taught the people correct principles and the governed themselves and also President Boyd K Packer who said "True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behaviors." It has been an interesting topic to study. At zone conference I shared about how in 3 Nephi 11 when Jesus Christ comes, the first thing he teaches is the most important doctrine, that He is the Savior and He atoned for us. Then he eventually talks about the priesthood authority and the doctrine of Christ. So it is important to focus on the doctrine and not necessarily on the applications. 
                        <br><br>
                        We did a roleplay where we taught repentance and baptism to these two older member guys. The only feedback they gave us was that they didn't like that we had to wear our masks. They were old and couldn't hear. But we have to follow the rules so I thought it was useless feedback. 
                        <br><br>
                        We got pizza for lunch. Sister Guthrie talked about her friend that climbed Mount Everest. She talked about Sherpas and how we need to commit to following the prophet. I don't think I would ever climb Mount Everest. 
                        <br><br>
                        Friday we had exchanges and I was here in my area with Sister Stephens. We had a fun day and were able to go drop cookies by and visit some of the members of our ward who are struggling. We also got to teach Joann about personal revelation. She doesn't have many desires to change anything, but it was still a good discussion. We went to pho for lunch. 
                        <br><br>
                        Saturday we had our interviews with President Guthrie. There was a big thunderstorm the night before so when we got to the mission office the power was out. My interview was really good. I love President Guthrie. We were able to reflect how much I have changed since our first interview. President compared me to a lump of clay that the Lord is shaping. I must admit, I really did feel like a lump of clay at the beginning of my misssion. I know I'm nowhere near the creation that God wants me to be, but I feel like I'm starting to take shape now. I don't even want to tell yall how many days I have left as a missionary, just know that it's not enough. 
                        <br><br>
                        Sunday we were able to have Kelly and Joann come to church with us. We found out that our Stake President is in one of our wards and nobody told us. In our coordination meeting for Jones Creek, we talked about a recent convert Ryan that we were able to teach this week and the members on the call didn't even know that he was a recent convert! Things slip through the cracks sometimes. Good thing there are missionaries.
                        <br><br>
                        Spiritual Thought:
                        <br><br>
                        Romans 6:17-18
                        17 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
                        18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
                        <br><br>
                        I found these verses when I was studying 2 Nephi 2 yesterday. They relate to what we were discussing at Zone Conference. I like how it says in verse 17 that we obey from the heart. I think that we can know the doctrines in our mind. We can know that God exists and that Christ atoned for us, but unless we let those doctrines into our hearts, it's not going to change us or our behavior. I know that as a missionary I have been able to truly study the doctrine. I finished the Book of Mormon this morning for the 9th time since starting to read on the plane to Houston 14 months ago. I know that a study of the doctrine has changed my behavior. I know my Savior more personally. His power has changed me and sculpted me. I love Him.
