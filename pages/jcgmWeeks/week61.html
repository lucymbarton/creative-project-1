                        Buenos d&iacute;as! 
                        <br><br>
                        This week seemed so long! I think that always happens when I get a new companion because everything is just so different so it makes the week seem longer. 
                        <br><br>
                        So my new companion is Hermana Murdock! She is brand new to the mission and she is from St. Augustin, Florida! But she lived for a while in Utah in Saratoga Springs! She is really cute and kind and she loves birds! I have never met anyone who knew so much about birds. She can literally just see one flying over and know exactly what kind of bird it is. So that's pretty cool. She was originally assigned to Guayaquil, Equador, (the west mission) but she was reassigned here to Houston. The weather here and in her hometown is almost exactly the same so she doesn't have much adjusting to do on that front. 
                        <br><br>
                        What kinda sucks is that we are both Spanish speaking missionaries but we are serving in an English area. So opportunities to speak Spanish, let alone teach in Spanish, are few and far between. But we take advantage of our hour of language study every day. I have already seen improvements in Hermana Murdock's Spanish! 
                        <br><br>
                        Okay so last Monday I was with Sister Stewart and we went to a pho place with the other sisters in our district and that was awesome. 
                        <br><br>
                        Tuesday we picked up our new companions! We walked into the gym singing called to serve and then we got to meet our comps! They also fed us Subway :) We came home to the apartment and then decided to take our bikes out. It was hot but we were able to talk to a few people! 
                        <br><br>
                        Wednesday our district made a goal to OYM (open your mouth) to 70 people this transfer. And they have to be in person and you have to at least mention Jesus Christ. So we've been trying hard to get out and find people to talk to. We were able to OYM 4 people this week. It is easier for me to talk to people when I'm trying to set a good example for Hermana Murdock. Because I honestly despise talking to strangers, especially in person and when trying to bring up Jesus Christ. It is so uncomfortable and most of the time leads to rejection. (unless they are Hispanic because most Hispanic people grew up speaking very openly about Jesus Christ) 
                        <br><br>
                        Thursday we had weekly planning. The STLs (Sister Training Leaders) came by our apartment and gave us some oreo cake pops that were so good. 
                        <br><br>
                        Friday, Princess and Princeton had their baptismal interviews! They passed!! They also came to church on Sunday so everything is a go for their baptism on the 15th!! They are so happy and their parents are so excited too that they decided they want to be baptized! :) 
                        <br><br>
                        Saturday we made a bunch of cookies and delivered them. We also have been helping a member Sister Thrift make a quilt for another member of our ward that recently got diagnosed with cancer. It has been fun to talk with Sister Thrift and also to learn how to quilt. 
                        <br><br>
                        Saturday night we had a lesson with our Recent Convert Zach with a member couple, the Haldas, present. We discussed Eternal Marriage and Zach said it was something he'd actually been thinking about but he's never dated anyone so he wasn't sure where to start. The Haldas had so many good things to tell him and they were also hilarious. It was a good lesson. 
                        <br><br>
                        Sunday was filled with Church two times, relief society two times, getting some cookies from the ward for mothers day, and we got to call our moms! 
                        <br><br>
                        Spiritual Thought:
                        Alma 56:48
                        48 And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it
                        <br><br>
                        This is one of my favorite stories in the Book of Mormon. The striping warriors, a bunch of young boys who went to war and were protected by the power of their faith in God, something that was taught to them by their mothers. I am so grateful for all of the mother figures in my life, my mom, my grandmothers, aunts, my companions, Sister Guthrie, all of the members that I've met. Something that I have learned on my mission is that no matter what trials you go through in life, if you stay true to the gospel, everything will be okay. I've met so many women who have gone through terrible things, divorce, death in the family, abuse, and so many other things, but because they stayed true to the gospel, they ended up still joyful and happy and okay. 
                        <br><br>
                        Love yall
                        <br><br>
                        Les quiero
